Dalvik vs ART -

Dalvik														
Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) approach, which results in lower storage space consumption but longer app load times 	
Cache builds up over time, so boot times are faster 	
Works better for lower internal storage devices as space occupied is lesser 	
Is stable and time tested – VM of choice for app developers 	

ART(Android RunTime)
Uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) approach, which compiles apps when they’re installed, resulting in faster load times and lower processor usage
Cache is built at first boot, hence rebooting device takes significantly longer
Consumes much more internal storage space since it stores compiled apps in addition to the APKs
Is highly experimental and new – not a lot of support from app developers yet

Generally when ever there is a configuration change in the phone, like screen orientation changes [or] soft keyboard availability [or] language changes, in these scenarios android will automatically kill and restart your activity to take the new resources effective.
But you have the choice of requesting android to not restart your activity, and you can handle configuration changes on your own.
This can be done by using android:configChanges property in your activity tag, of your manifest.xml file.

<activity android:name=".MyActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">

The above activity tag says to android that, don't kill and restart my activity in case of screen orientation or keyboard availability.
Instead android will call  onConfigurationChanged() of your activity.

URI : Uniform Resource Indicator. Used to access or send data in Android.

Just like how we access the data stored in the web servers by using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), Similarly we send or receive data in Android by using URI's

Some of the examples for URI's:
for telephone numbers we use "tel:<number>"
for content stored in databases we use "content:// ...."
for emails we use "email: <email>"

This is similar to how we access gmail by using "http://gmail.com"

What is system.out.println? Why we use this in Java? (java)
This line System.out.println() is used to print the arguments passed to it on standard output.
System is the final class, out is the public static final variable of PrintStream class, and println() is the function of PrintStream class.

There are two contexts in Android.
1. Activity level context
2. Application level context

Application level context will be created while creating your application. There will be only one application context shared for all the components of your application.
So if you want to share some temporary variables with all the components of your application, then create your own class which extends Application class. Use setters and getters to share some variables in that class.

Note: Make sure that you give android:name as your class which extended Application class,in the <application .. >tab of manifest file.

The other uses of Application class is, if you want to do some task before loading your first activity, then write it in Application class's onCreate() method. Application class also has some useful methods which will get triggered in case of low memory,
 which you can use to check if your app is running on low memory to alert user.

2. what is viewholder?
ViewHolder is a technique used in Adapter's getView() method,
to reduce the no of findViewById() calls.
Adapters are intelligent enough to reuse the old views while user scrolls throught the adapter view elements. 
Programmer should check if convertView is not null, then reuse it rather than creating a new view for that row.
Apart from this we can optimize it more by reducing number of findViewById() calls by moving all those into ViewHolder class.
Programmer can also move some reusable components like arrays or database query results also into ViewHolder to avoid unncessery function calls.

What is an Interface and What is an Abstract class? (java)
Abstract class: is an incomplete class. This is a kind of a house under construction which is not yet completed.
                            Since abstract classes are incomplete, you can't create any object for that class. It doesn't make any sense to create object.
                            But any one can inherit abstract classes to give extra definition for that class to make it more concrete.
                            Abstract class can contain 0 or more number of abstract methods. If it is having at least one abstract method, then
                            we have to make that class as abstract class.
                            A class will become abstract class, if we know only partial implementation of that class.
                            Abstract class can contain method definitions.

Interface: as name suggests, it is an interface between your class and out side world.
                  interfaces can contain only constants, method declarations, and nested types. It can't contain method definitions.
                  Just like an abstract class, you can't create object for an interface.
                  You can imagine interface just like a header file in c program. It tells what all the functionalities supported by your interface.

Explain about Async Task with one use case
Async Task: is a way to achieve multi threading in android. It has some advantages over normal java threads.
                       1. You don't need to use any Thread keyword, every thing will be taken care by AsyncTask class internally.
                            It creates threads internally.
                        2. Since android follows single threaded UI model, where other threads can't touch UI components directly.
                             But from async task you can directly touch UI components from all the functions except from doInBackGround().

AsyncTask class will have 4 functions.
a. onPreExecute() - this is the first function to be called before calling doInBackGround(). This runs in UI thread. You can touch ui from this.
b. doInBackGround() - this runs in background thread created by AsyncTask class. Don't touch ui from this method.
                                         Write background heavy logic in this function, as it runs in background thread.
c. onProgressUpdate() - this function is used to update UI while performing background functionality. to execute this call publishProgress()
                                             this also runs in UI thread.
d. onPostExecute() - once doInBackGround() is finished this function will be called. If you want to update any UI after doInBackGround() use this                                
                                     function. This also runs in main ui thread.

Async task use case: If you want to upload some images to facebook server and want to update UI (progress bar) while uploading images using progress bar, then you can use AsyncTask.

3. What is Mutable and Imutable explain with examples? (java)
There are many concepts related to mutability and immutability.

General meaning:
Mutable : means changeable;   Immutable : means unchangeable.

Some of the Immutable concepts:
----------------------------------------------
Immutable classes : are also known as final classes. A class which you can't inherit (can't change the definition by extending it) is called as
immutable class. In some languages it is also called as shield classes. Eg: String class in java is immutable class, you can't inherit it.
use case: If you don't want any one to inherit your class and change the basic functionality of your class, then make it as immutable class.
This can be achieved by making your class as final class by using "final" keyword before your class.

Immutable variables (also know as final variables): also known as constants
Any variable that is declared as final, you can't modify its value.
eg: public static final double pi = 3.14; // we know that pi value will always remain same 3.14, no body can change its value. So we are declaring it as final , ie constant. So that no one can change its value.

Immutable methods (final methods): says, no body can modify or change my functionality.
Inherited classes (derived classes) can't override immutable methods.
use case: Framework generally gives lot of basic functionality where derived classes can't change. such kind of methods are made as final methods by using "final" keyword before that method name.

Immutable objects: (Note: don't misunderstand this with immutable variables)
an object for which we can't change the states(data) of it once it is set. If we can achieve this , then that object is called as immutable object.
For eg: String str = "hello";
In the above example hello is immutable, no body can change it. If you try to change it it will create a new string object.
String objects are examples of immutable objects.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Difference between Final ,Finally and Finalize (java)
final - means immutable. eg: final classes, final methods, final variables.
           once you say final, it is the final definition of that component, no one can change it.

finally - is used with try-catch block to make sure that you are cleaning all the system resources properly when an exception occurs.
             what ever the code you write, will be executed with out fail once try block exits.

finalize - is the method that will be executed(called) before that object is being garbage collected.
                Garbage collector will make sure that it will finalize() method of an object, before it cleans that object.
                Garbage collector will clean only java resources and java memory. In your program if you are using any non java resources like files,  
                sockets, graphic contexts, or allocating memory using a c program then garbage collector will not clean all those resources.
                It is the responsibility of the programmer to clean them properly, For that we use finalize method.
                Note: Don't depend too much on finalize() method to clean non java resources.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

What is thread? Why we use Thread? (java)
Thread: is independent dispatch-able unit to cpu. each thread can execute an independent module in parallel with CPU.
               Thread is also known as light weight process. Each process can contain multiple threads.
               Threads will share the resources of its process.

Why to use a thread: Generally your CPU might have the capability of running multiple tasks at a time by using its threads.
                                      But programmer has to support this by creating multiple threads for his program where ever it is possible.
                                      If your program is having two modules, and there is no dependency between those two modules, then
                                      your program can run faster if you run both the modules at a time (in parallel). This can be done only
                                      if you are running those two modules in two different threads.

What is a Broadcast Receiver?
Broadcast Receiver: is the component of android which gets triggered when ever android systems sends a broadcast announcement.
                                      Generally, when ever an important event happens in the phone (like battery low), android system will send a broad
                                      cast message to all the applications. Who ever is interested to catch that message can use Broadcast Receiver to
                                      handle that message.

Note: Broadcast receiver has a time limitation of 10 seconds. What ever you want to do in a receiver, you have to finish it off in 10 seconds.
           Else android may force close your receiver.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

What is an Intent?
Intent: is a message passing mechanism between 2 components of android.
There are 2 use cases of intents.

1. You can start other component using intent, except content provider.
    eg: you can start one activity from other activity by using intent. 
           You can also start a service from an activity.

2. You can use intent to pass some data from one component to other component.
    Eg: you can pass username and password from login screen to home screen of your application.

There are two types of intents are there in android. a. Explicit intent b. Implicit intent.

How do you know whether GPS is on or Off in your moble?
//declare location manager
LocationManager lm;
//define location listner
private LocationListener ll = new LocationListener() {
 @Override
 public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) {
  //called when user enables gps or wifi in the phone
 }
 @Override
 public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) {
  // called when user disables gps or wifi in the phone 
 }
};

//create location manager object
lm = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
//request for location updates
lm.requestLocationUpdates(
   LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 
   0, 0, ll);


12. If GPS is not on is there any other way to find the location?
If GPS is not available, then you can use NETWORK_PROVIDER which uses wi-fi signals or cell tower information to find out your mobile location.

How do we solve Resolution Problem
There are many solutions for this resolution problem:

1. Always use dps, don't use pixels
2. Use nine patch (.9.png) images in places of normal images. Normal png images won't stretch properly.
3. Use relative layouts where ever it is possible.
4. Don't give hard coded width and height, always mention height and width relative to parent view or layout.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

If you have multiple Broadcast receivers how do you identify for which application is it coming?
Ans:  if the question is how does Android sends broadcasted message to different application, then it is based on the action, data, and category present in the intent.
Android will perform action test, data & type test, and category test. If all the test are passing with any of the intent filters of receivers, then those receivers will be triggered.
If multiple receivers intent-filters are matching with the intent then all the receivers will be triggered. But there is no specific order if priority is not set in the intent filter.

Do you require any key for development?
If you are planning to release any application into the market, then it is mandatory to sign your application with private key.
But at the initial stages, you can use debug key which is located in c:\users\<username>\.android folder.
But remember you can't release an application which is signed with your debug key. You have to sign with a private key obtained with keytool
command. keytool is a .bat file available in java\jdk\bin folder.
You can use keytool to create your own private key with password.
Note: Important to remember that don't ever forget your key and password, else it would become impossible to upgrade your application.
To upgrade your application you have to sign with same application.

More about how to create private key and how to use keytool, please refer to below official android link.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

How do you upload app into playstore?
If you want to upload an app into google play store, then follow below steps.
1. Create a private key to sign your application.
   Note: to create private key, use keytool command.
2. sign your application with private key.
   Go to file->export-> and select your private keystore to sign.
3. Go to https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/
4. If you are uploading your first app, then you have to pay one time reg
   fee of $25.
5. Go to developer console
6. Click on add new application +
7. Add apk and title , and follow with rest of the process.

How do you start push Notifications?
If this question is about sending a push notification to the client mobiles from the server, then Server side program has to be configured to use GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). Once the server is configured to use GCM and client android app also configured with GCM client framework, then GCM will automatically push the notifications from server to the client mobile by using GCM framework.

More about using GCM framework to send push notifications from server to client (android phones), follow this official android link.

What is debugging mode?
You can build your application in 2 modes.
1. Debug Mode : Generally we use debug mode when we develop and test our application.
2. Release Mode : We use release mode, when we are about to release our application into play store.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Can we create .apk file without eclipse?If yes how?
1. use javac to compile your java files
2. use dx tool to convert all .class files to single dex file
3. use aapt tool or apkbuilder tool to generate .apk file, which contains    manifest, .dex, and res.
   .apk is equivalent to .jar in java.
   aapt tool and dx tools are in android-sdk/platform-tools.
4. sign the apk file by using jarsigner tool of jdk/bin
5. zipalign your signed apk by using zipalign tool of android-sdk/tools

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Can we show multiple activity at a time? If no why? Also asked what is activity?
In android activities are piled up on each other in a stack based architecture. System will display the activity which is on top of the activity stack, hence it is no possible to show 2 activities at a time.

But there is an option called ActivityGroup, which can contain and run multiple embedded activities in a screen. One such kind of ActivityGroup is TabActivity.

Note: TabActivity and ActivityGroup are deprecated, better to use Fragments to club multiple screens in a screen.

Fragment is the new technique added in 3.0 onwards, which are basically used to club different screens(panes) in a single wider screen sizes like Tablets.

Note: Don't use TabHost and TabActivity, as they are deprecated.
In place of them use ActionBar and fragments. ActionBar is something like TabHost in old versions. ActionBar also contains tabs, on clicking which it will display different fragments.

What is android? Where we can use android OS other than mobiles, tabs etc?
Android is O.S and framework to develope applicatins for mobiles and tablets.
Android is based on Linux O.S.
Android can be used in tvs, automobiles, and wears like watches, glasses etc.
Android is also used in kitchen utensils which is also called Google's smart kitchen.
Android can also be used in robots, washing machines, etc.

How to support text views for multiple screens?Suppose one mobile 3 inch another 7 inch?
When we are using a textview there is a possibility that our app may be downloaded into various screen size devices.
Based on the screen sizes we have to make sure our textview should grow and shrink, similarly the text size also should look compatible with the screen size. Below is the solution for this problem.

various screen sizes have various folders for dimensions.
eg:
res/values/dimens.xml will contain screen properties for normal screens.
res/values-sw600dp/dimens.xml will contain screen properties for screen width category 600 dp.
So try to declare different text sizes for different screen widths.
This will work perfectly with all screen sizes.

Note: Using sp or dp will not fix your issue.
Note: If you are not specifiying sp or dp, then giving wrap content or match_parent would be the best suggestion to solve the problem

Difference between Set and Array List? (java)
set interface: 1. Sets can't contain duplicate values (just like a mathematical set), 
                         2. Sets inherits collection and adds method to avoid duplications

There are 3 Set implementations:

1. hashset
   - uses hash table/ hashmap internally to store values, 
   - it is very fast compared to other two set implementations, 
   - it will not have any order while reading, 
   - it will not contain any duplicate elements, 
   - it is not synchronized by default
   - will not guarantee any order over time
   - iteration order/ reading order is not predictable.
     the order in which u entered may differ while reading.

2. treeset
   - internally uses red-black tree to store the values, 
   - it will maintain ascending order
   - it is slowest of all other 2 set implementations.
   - rest of the properties remain same

3. linkedhash set
   - internally uses hash table with linked list to store values.
   - same as hashset but order in which user entered will be persisted.
   - it is neither fast nor slow comparatively.
   - rest of the properties remain same.


list
----
 - it is ordered (maintains the insertion order) & may contain duplicate values
 - inherits from collection, and add functions for indexof, search functionalities.

List implementations
1. arraylist  (better performance) - same as vector .. 
2. linked list (better performace in some circumstances)

What is an Interface? Explain with realtime use case? (java)
Interface: as name suggests, it is an interface between your class and out side world.
                  interfaces can contain only constants, method declarations, and nested types. It can't contain method definitions.
                  Just like an abstract class, you can't create object for an interface.
                  You can imagine interface just like a header file in c program. It tells what all the functionalities supported by your interface.
                   
Use cases of Interfaces:

1. It can be used as APIs for third party libraries or server side libraries when using with client application. This is the main use case.
    Eg: If you are selling some libraries to some clients, then you will not expose the code. Rather you give in terms of .lib format.
          But since lib is unreadable format, you have to create an interface file telling what all the functions available in that library.
    Eg: Similarly if you want to access some server side functionalities in your client application, then also we use interfaces with some libraries.

2. You can use interfaces to implement multiple inheritance.

What is a Handler & what is the function of the Handler in Android?
Handler : is used to communicate between two threads.

Use of Handler: If you want to send or pass some message from one thread to other thread, then we can use Handlers.
                             1. A thread can have n number of handlers allowing other threads to communicate with it.
                             2. If we have Thread-A and Thread-B, and if Thread-B wants to send a message to Thread-A, then We have to create a handler
                                  for Thread-A and send message to that handler. Via handler Thread-B can send messages to Thread-A.

What is Anchor View in a Relative layout?
Anchor view tells about the relative position of view with respect to a given anchor view.
For eg: android:layout_above property will make sure that the current view's base line will be above the anchor view id given in this property.

More about anchor:
----------------------------
android:layout_above  Positions the bottom edge of this view above the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignBaseline  Positions the baseline of this view on the baseline of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignBottom  Makes the bottom edge of this view match the bottom edge of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignEnd  Makes the end edge of this view match the end edge of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignLeft  Makes the left edge of this view match the left edge of the given anchor view ID.

How to pass the objects to all activities?
If you want to pass objects between activities, there are multiple options for this.
1. You can implement Serializable for that class, and then pass serializable object in putExtra of intent.
2. Since serializables are heavy compared to parcels, second and better option can be passing parcels in extras.

1st way:
-----------
class ABC implements Serializable{
 ....
}

ABC a = new ABC();
Intent in = new Intent();
in.putExtra("class",a); //this should take serializable objects

2nd way:
------------
Though parcels are fast compared to serializables, but building a parcel is very tough and complicated.
It may affect the readability of the program. Parcels are heavily used only in IPCs (Inter Process Communications) and Binder Services by android
Otherwise to make it simple for reading, better to go with serializables.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Have u worked on AIDL?
Only if one is working on binder services, then only there is a fair chance of working on AIDL. IPC (Inter Process Communication) in android happens through kernel level Binder driver.
AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) is a mechanism which internally uses Binders to access or to bind services of other applications.
Binder is an efficient way to do IPC when compared to serialization, thats why AIDL adopts Binder.

When a client application binds a remote service (which is in other application), that service will return an object using which client can call remote methods.
Since both client and service are in different applications, client would not know the type of object which is going to be returned. This is where AIDL
will be useful. 

Steps to implement AIDL in service side (server side):
1. create aidl file, which contains function declarations which you want to expose to the client.
2. implement interface stub method in your service file.
3. create an object for stub and return it as binder object to client

steps to implement AIDL in client side:
1. implement ServiceConnection object, and get the binder object in 
onServiceConnected() method, using aidl file interface name which was exposed by service. 
2. Start calling remote methods by using that object.

What is the use of registering broadcast receiver in manifest file?
Registering a receiver in manifest file makes sure that our receiver will be triggered even if our application is not running currently. For example when a new incoming SMS comes it should be handled by Messaging 
application even if it is not running currently. In this case programmer has to register the receiver in messaging application's manifest file to respond to incoming sms.

Can we create all ui coding  in activity without using xml?
Ui can be completely created through programming. But that is not recommended. There should be clear separation between design and the logic. That is the reason why android has given res folder to create all the designs 
like layouts, menus, icons, and styles. If project demands some dynamic changes to the UI, which can't be done in the xml files, then programmer can use any View or ViewGroup classes to design the UI through programming.


lLayout = new LinearLayout(this);
        lLayout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);
LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
        tView = new TextView(this);
        tView.setText("Hello, This is a view created programmatically!");
        tView.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(
LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
        lLayout.addView(tView);
        setContentView(lLayout);

When I run any application where fragments are there which method will be called first?
Just like Activities has life cycle methods, similarly fragments also have their life cycle methods. When we load a fragment first method to be called is onAttach(), followed by onCreate(), which is followed by onCreateView(). 
Generally programmers will not implement onAttach() method. onCreate() is where we will initialize all the variables which are used in the fragment. onCreateView() is where we will inflate or load the xml file of our fragment and return it to the parent (activity).

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Can we have fragments without activity?
It is not possible to have fragment with out an activity. Fragments are part of activity. Fragments always lies with in the activity. An activity can exist without a fragment where as fragment with out an activity is not possible. 
You can assume fragment like a thread and activity is like a process, where threads are always part of a process. Every fragment will contribute its own UI to the parent activity.

Asked about memory leakage?How to handle it
To fix memory leaks, first we should know if our application is leaking any memory. For that use Logcat and check for GC messages and observe if free memory is going down. To understand this you can rotate your phone for couple 
of times and observe gc messages in logcat if free memory is going down. If you see that free memory is going down, that is an indication of memory leak. To fix memory leaks you can use MAT(memory analyzer tool) of eclipse. Before doing that you should create a hprof file which contains the memory status of your application. Open up hprof file in the memory analyzer tool to check for dominator tree and find out what is causing for your memory leak. Note: 70-80% of the memory will leaked by bitmap images, so be careful while using them, and try to avoid un necessery static pointers to them to avoid memory leaks.

intent - is a message passing mechanism between components of android, except for Content Provider. You can use intent to start any component.

Sticky Intent - Sticks with android, for future broad cast listeners. For example if BATTERY_LOW event occurs then that intent will be stick with android so that if any future user requested for BATTER_LOW, it will be fired;

Pending Intent - If you want some one to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use Pending Intent.

Bottom-line, JIT compilation was the best solution available at the time for early-generation ARM CPUs where resources were tight and CPU clock cycles at a premium. Today, with CPU cores coming out of our ears and GBs of RAM to play with, a just-in-time view of code processing is no longer necessary, so Google has spent the last two years working on Project ART or Android RunTime.

Android RunTime replaces Dalvic’s JIT compiler with a new AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) version. Instead of on-the-fly processing, the whole app is now pre-compiled into machine-code just once upon installation, not just part of it at run-time, which should bring a number of benefits. First, CPU-bound apps will now run faster and time-bound apps more efficiently by removing JIT compiling — apps now exist as native code thanks to compilation on installation. Second, there should be some improvement to battery life, again, through removing JIT compiling — less code processing means greater CPU efficiency, which results in better battery life. Remember, with Dalvic, every app launches JIT compilation every time it runs unless the compiled bytecode still exists in the memory cache — so while it might be efficient from a resources viewpoint, JIT isn’t terribly efficient on a CPU scale.

Android RunTime will have some downsides but they’re relatively minor — because of the AOT compilation, apps will need more RAM during installation and they’ll need more storage space after it. You’ll still be downloading bytecode from Google Play (little changes for the developer and user), but native-code compilation will need more RAM to perform. Replacing the Dalvic interpreter also means more code has to be compiled, ready to run — word is apps will now have roughly a 20% larger footprint on your phone/tablet’s storage than before. However, with phone storage near enough to ten times what it was just a few years ago, that’s not really much of an issue (unless your phone is clogged with apps and you’re on fixed storage.)
Like Linux, Android makes use of shared object (.so) libraries — the Dalvic virtual machine comes via libdvm.so, while the new Android RunTime engine is built into libart.so. Although KitKat is available now through Google’s Nexus 5 smartphone, it’s also part of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which means you’ll find it in new open-source KitKat-based ROMs like CyanogenMod and OmniROM.

When you first switch to using Android RunTime, Android runs through your app list, compiling them into native code — and the process can take upwards of five minutes, depending on your device and the number of apps you have preinstalled. After that, the users see nothing different functionally.

What doesn’t work?

But Android RunTime (ART) is still considered experimental by Google, so while it’s not quite ready for prime time, it’s good enough for developers to get a look at it. At this stage, not every Android app works and even at this early stage, there’s a growing app compatibility list via XDA Developers Forum at www.androidruntime.com/list. Obviously, it’s not complete, but there were around 2000 apps on the list at time of writing with about 20% (397 of 1980) so far tested found to be not working under ART.
Performance differences

Rather than just say ART feels faster, we threw a few of the usual APC benchmarks at it, comparing the performance differences between ART and Dalvic using OmniROM on a Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 smartphone. However, you do have to be careful with benchmarks to make sure you know what it is that you’re actually testing.

Basically, any app that makes extensive use of Android’s Native Development Kit (NDK) isn’t likely to see much of an improvement, since these apps are already running significant chunks of compiled native code. Others that use straight bytecode should see some extra zip.
And that’s exactly how it turned out. The IceStorm test inside 3DMark improved little — in fact, it went slightly backwards under ART, just why it’s not clear, but the lack of improvement made sense since it relies heavily on NDK. The same happened with GFXBench 2.7.2 and GeekBench 3.0 — it’s compiled using GCC 4.8 (GNU C++ Compiler).

Where things became more interesting was the Linpack and Quadrant Standard tests — Linpack’s performance jumped by more than a third on single-thread testing, a bit more than a fifth on multi-threaded tests; Quadrant results were similar, particularly on the CPU test. Based on this AOSP-implementation of ART, it suggests NDK-built apps won’t see much improvement (at least for the moment) whereas bytecode-based apps are currently gaining as much as a third extra speed. (Some are reporting as much as 100% speed improvements with official Google releases).

get current location in android?
i. Use either GPS location provider or Network location provider to fetch the current location of a phone, in terms of latitude and longitude.
ii. Use LocationManager class, and LocationListener class to fetch locations. Use requestLocationUpdates to register locationlistener with locationmanager object.
iii. When ever location gets changed, location manager will automatically call onLocationChanged() method of locationlistner.
iv. Use ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permissions in the manifest file.

What does below sensor code do?
sm = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);
List<Sensor> ls = sm.getSensorList(Sensor.TYPE_ALL);
It is creating sensor manager object, and fetching all sensors available in phone of all sensor types.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Accelerometer sensor will sens the acceleration force on all 3 axes (x,y,z) and send that even to onSensorChanged().
SensorEvent object is a data structure which will contain all the information about incoming sensor event.. event.values[0] - contains x value, event.values[1] - contains y value, event.values[2] - contains z value.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Accelerometer is used to find the gravitational force on all 3-axes.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Proximity sensor is used to find the the distance of an object from the phone.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
GyroScope is used to find the motion of phone on each axis.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Magnetometer & proximity sensors belong to positional sensor type.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If we forget to un-register a sensor after registering, then that sensor will keep running in the background, and consumes lot of battery power un-necessarily.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
To find location of your phone there are two ways. 1.using network provider info, which makes use of nearest cell tower information or WiFi information to find location. how ever it is not so accurate but gives you nearest location details. it is faster and take less batter power. 2. GPS provider, which makes use of satellites to fetch information of your phone. it is very accurate most of the times and gives exact location details. how ever it is slow and may take more batter power. both will not cost you any thing.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If battery is draining out, then we should not use too much of battery power. Using GPS or WiFi will take lot of battery power. so either use network provider with cell tower or use GPS and get last known location.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
if GPS is disabled then  onProviderDisabled() function of LocationListener class will be called with provider name.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
NETWORK_PROVIDER will fetch locations either by using WiFi point or cell tower information. for cell tower we have to use COARSE_LOCATION permission and for WiFi we have to use FINELOCATION permission.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
GeoCoding is part of location's package. It is not related with Maps library.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
String locationProvider = LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER;
// Or use LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER
Location lastKnownLocation = locationManager.getLastKnownLocation(locationProvider);
This should give your last known location. Use GPS_PROVIDER for better results.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - use this if you are using GPS features in your programming. else android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION - use this if you are fetching locations based on career network or by using WiFi.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Even if there are no cell tower signal, no WiFi access point, and no satellite signal, still we can find last known location using any of the above two providers. use lastKnownLocation() using locationmanager object.
Note : if GPS was turned off recently, then you can get the last known location from gps, which gives more relevant location.

android is popular
i. Because android is free platform to develope mobile applications. android is under apache license, which means you can download code and use it for free of cost and make money out of it. No one asks for any royalty fee. Profits margins are very high. That's why many service based companies like infosys and cts also entering into mobile field.
ii. Android programming is done in java, which is very poplur for its simplicity. Any one can learn java very easily and program. Since android is based on java, application development time will be reduced and applications can be released very fastly.
iii. Since android software is free, mobile device costs has reduced drastically making smart phones available for even a common man. This is also one more reason to make it most successful platform for mobile devices.
iv. Android can be used on almost any kind of embedded devices like robots, traffic signals, bmw cars, washing machines, TVs, tablets, notebooks, sony wrist watches, etc.. There is no end for its usability.
v. Google and 83 other companies (OHA) backs android to make it successfulby contributing code to android for free of cost.

android is better than ios
i. ios programs are Developed in c-with-objects which is very tough for normal programmers to code. Android is based on java which is very easy to code. This is the first major advantage of android over iOS. There is huge developer forum community help for java developers, where as very less forum communities for ios.
ii. Too many restrictions to publish ios applications in apple play store. There are no restrictions to upload android applications into google play store.
iii. ios applications runs only on apple approved hardware, chipsets and ios. Where as Android applications can run on any android powered device as longs as that runs a linux flavoured operating system and containsi android sdk. android is not limited for only mobiles. It can be used to develop applications for tablets, notepads, robots, wrist watches, etc. There is pure monopoly in ios in terms of controlling who can develope and manufacture. 
iv. android is a free software, any one can download use and make money out of it. Google won't object. But ios is not free ware, one has to pay huge royalty to use it.

Why android comes into existence?

1.Google's Entry into electronic devices to make its search and other apps where ever it is possible.
2.Google can increase its ad-revenue from mobile devices also, if it penetrates into mobiles.
3.To increase user exp in mobile usage.
4.Creating mobile eco system build on top of GOOGLE-ANDROID, so that it can build its existing desktop empire on it.
5.To support individual developers and small companies to come up with innovative ideas to develope apps and earn money with out paying any royalty.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Why android is slow?
While using android phone after some time user may feel like android is very slow.there can be multiple reasons for this.
i. User might have loaded tons of applications and data. First check for how much memory is available by going to settings-sdcard & phone storage.
ii. Too many back ground services might be running which consumes lot of memory. Eg: facebook service, google map service, and other google services always keep running in the background to sync data from gmail and facebook.
So when it is not required, you can forcefully close those services by going to settings-applications-running services.
iii. Recent firmware upgrade might be one more reason. Don't upgrade to all latest versions on your age old hardware which really can't accommodate all the new features which requires upgraded hardware as well. Many people will try to forcefully upgrade to new android releases by rooting the phone, which is wrong.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between android and windows?

i. windows phones are based on windows phone platform which is owned by Microsoft.
android phones are based on android platform with linux o.s which is backed and supported by Google.
ii. Windows phone platform is closed software (proprietry), where as android platform is open source which is free for every one.
iii. there are very less number of free apps for windows phones in play stores.
There are more than 7lack android apps in play store. Most of the android apps in play store are free applications. User don't need to pay for downloading apps.
iv. Windows phones uses bing as the default search engine in the phone. Android phones uses google as the default search engine in the phone.
v. Most of the windows phones are released under NOKIA brand as it is acquired by microsoft. Most of the android phones are released with Samsung, LG, and other brands.
vi. Many of the phone manifacturing companies like samsung, lg, huawei, micromax, prefers android as it is free source so that the profit margins are very high compared to windows.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
dex file means?
1. Android programs are compiled into .dex (Dalvik Executable) files to execute with DVM. dex files are light weight when compared to .class files, and takes less memory and runs faster.
2. DEX files are used to initialize and execute applications developed for the Android mobile OS. 3. DVM (Dalvik Virtual Machine) where an android application runs, can understand only .dex files. It can't understand .class files.
Just like all java programs runs in JVM, similarly all android applications runs in DVM. But DVM can understand only .dex files, it can't understand .class files. Dex full form is dalvik executable. Dex files are light weight when compared to .class files. 
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
src folder contains source files .java, .c etc. gen folder will contain automatic generated files like R.java. Bin folder will contain binary files which are generated after compiling and linking like .class files and .apk file. Res folder will contain various resources required for your project. This folder again contains many sub folders like menu folder to create menus, layout folder to create layouts for your activities, drawable folder to store images used in your project. values folder will contain styles and strings related xml files.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
solve compatability issues

1. Use dp (density independent pixels) in place of px for view width and height.
2. Create verious density image with same name for drawable- mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi.
3. Use nine-patch images for better scaling with out blur effect.
4. Avoid hard coded width and height values, and always give width and height with respect to parent.
5. Use fragments if you are targeting your application for both mobiles and tablets.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android is based on Linux 3.6 version.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Top two layers (application, and Framework layers) are written in Java. Where as drivers layer and library layer are written in c and c++.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android team preferred DVM over JVM because of below given reasons.
1. Though JVM is free it was under GPU license, which is not good for Android as most of the Android is under Apache license. 
2. JVM was designed by keep desktops in mind. So it is too heavy for embedded devices.
3. DVM takes less memory, runs & loads faster compared to JVM.
4. Since mobile devices have lot of limitations like low CPU speed and less Memory, it is always better not to use heavy components like JVM.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Every android application runs in DVM. To run an application it requires memory, process, threads and other resources. But all these resources are under control of kernel. So DVM has to interact with driver layer for memory and thread management, it sits just above driver layer (that is.. it sits in library layer)
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Version no and name will be useful when you upload some application to play store and wanted to update it. When you are upgrading your application then you can increment the version number so that users of your application will get notification on their phones about the latest updates available.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Yes, it is possible. You can create resources with code also, with out having your xml files.
For eg: below code will work with out setting xml file as the layout for your activity.
onCreate(...)
{
    super.onCreate(..);
    TextView tv = new TextView(this);
    tv.setText("hello world");
    setContentView(tv);
}
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
configuration changes include: rotating the phone, having virtual keypad on, and changing language settings in settings.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Implicit intent - Intent with out target component name; Explicit intent - Intent with target component name. 

EG: if we want to start a new screen or activity with in our application, then we clearly know what is that activity name because both activities are in same application. In such cases we will use explicit intent. 
Assume that we want to launch Gallery activity from our application, then we don't know exact name of that gallery activity because gallery is a different application, in that case we will use implicit intent with some matching actions.

Eg for Explicit intent:
Intent in = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), SecondScreen.class); //target component name
startActivity(in);
Note: Explicit intents are specifically used to start other components of same application.

Eg for Implicit intent:
Intent in = new Intent(); //no target component name
in.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
in.setType("image/*");
startActivity(in);
Note: Iplicit intents are specifically used to start components of other applications.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Intent can have a.action, b.data and its type, c.category, d. extras, e.Target Component name, f. some extra flags.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Intent can have maximum one action, but it is not mandatory. some times it can have 0 actions also (in case of explicit intent). So an intent can have 0-1 actions.
Unlike actions, an intent can choose to have 0 or n number of categories.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
setData() - is to pass data on which to take action. putExtra() - is to send extra information about this intent. 
EG: if one is starting an activity to perform ACTION_CALL, then he has to set number in setData(). this function will contain on which data target component has to take action. if one want to pass extra details also, then only use putExtra().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Unlike startActivity() and startService(); sendBroadcast() will not throw any run time exception. If there are no target components available for this broadcast it will keep quiet. It is because in case of activity and service, action is yet to be performed but in case of broadcastReceiver action is already over and we are just informing it to every one.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
for startActivity(intent), if there are no matching target components or activities, then it will throw run time exception - ActivityNotFoundException, and will crash the program if this exception is not handled.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
intent - is a message passing mechanism between components of android, except for Content Provider. You can use intent to start any component.
Sticky Intent - Sticks with android, for future broad cast listeners. For example if BATTERY_LOW event occurs then that intent will be stick with android so that if any future user requested for BATTER_LOW, it will be fired; 
Pending Intent - If you want some one to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use Pending Intent. Eg: Booking a ticket at late night when your application is not running. In this scenario we will create a pending intent to start a service which can book tickets at late night and hand it over to Alarm Manager to fire it at that time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

<manifest> is the root tag for Manifest file.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is rooting?
It is the process of allowing users of smartphones, and other android enabled devices to get the privileged permissions (root access).
rooting allows to run any appliction that requires admin level permissions in the android system And can perform any operation which is not allowed by normal android user.
rooting is also done to overcome the limitations set by carriers and OEM (original equipment manufacturers) on a phone. Rooted phone can be used any where with any carrier network.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
difference between permission and uses-permission in android
i. permission tag is used to enforce a user defined permission on a component of your application.
ii. uses-permission tag is used to take a permission from the user for your application.
iii. permission tag is used when you want other applications to seek permission from the user to use some of your applications components.

android sdk contains set of libraries, APIs, and set of tools to develop, test, and debug android applications for android powered devices.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
android emulator
It is a tool used to run android applications with out having real hardware device. This can be used to test an android application without having a real physical device.
Android emulator simulates the real hardware device environment in workstations where programmer is developing android applications.
android emulator tool comes as a part of android SDK while downloading. Emulator.exe tool is part of android-sdk\tools folder.

What is android device manager?
android device manager is a google tool with which user can locate a phone (if stolen).Optionally user can ring the phone, lock the phone, and erase the data on the phone. But for that user should be registered with google account with his mobile number.
Location data from user device will be collected and sent to Google.
Device location is approximate. To track your mobile using android device manager visit https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is android application?
i. An application that runs on any android powered device using android framework, is called as android application.
ii. Android application runs in a sandbox , an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources.
iii. Android applications runs in linux Operating system.

what is MODE_PRIVATE when creating shared preference file?
MODE_PRIVATE is meant for accessibility permission for an application. only that app which has created that preference file can access it.
getSharedPreferences("name", MODE_PRIVATE);
If the preference file is having some name, then only other activities can access it.
MODE_PRIVATE says it is accessible with in the application.

What does below code do?

in.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
in.setType("image/*");
startActivityForResult(in, 1);
It will start gallery app, even if there are no images in the gallery.after selecting any image in gallery, it will return the URI of that image to this caller. 
Note: if there are no images in the gallery, then you can start camera from there, capture an image, and it will return that captured image as URI to the calling activity.

service process priority (3)
Empty process is priority 5. that is last priority (least priority).
Note: in case of low memory scenarios, android will start killing from empty processes.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Either we can use getSharedPreferences("name",MODE_WORLD_READABLE); or getSharedPreferences("name",MODE_WORLD_WRITABLE);
Note: But accessing or sharing preference file to outside world is deprecated with recent versions. so it is no more supported. But in older versions you can use above mentioned flags to share a preference file with outside world applications.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
There are two types of contexts available in android to create any component.
1. this context (or) this pointer
2. application context

When programmer wants to create any component or control, then you have to use one of the contexts.
eg: TextView t = new TextView(this); 
Here we are using this pointer (context).
eg: static TextView st = new TextView(getApplicationContext());
Here we are using application context, because it is a static variable whose life time will be through out application life time.
If you use this pointer here, then it will leak memory (memory wastage) of your activity.

When to use this & getapplicationcontext:
1.If the control or variable you are creating should belong to application level then use applicationContext.
2.If the control or variable you are creating should belong to Activity level then use this pointer or this context.

Note: Generally people will think that java will not have memory leaks. But if you don't use contexts properly, then it might lead to some dangerous memory leaks in your android application.
Tip : Don't ever link between this pointer and static variables. If you follow this simple tip, you can almost reduce most of your memory leaks in your program.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Binder is used if both client and server are in same application.

If client and service (server) are in different applications, then this can be implemented in two ways:
1. Messenger - is a simple way to implement binder service, which is single threaded mode.
With this, your service can handle only one client request at a time. 
2. aidl (Android interface definition language) - use it if you want multi threaded capability for your server/service.
With this, your service can handle multiple requests at a time. But little complicated.
Make sure that you are writing always thread safe program in your service when using with aidls.
This is not recommended for most of the implementations.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
difference between service and intentservice in android
i. Intentservice by default will create one separate thread to handle the service functionality. All the startservice requests for intentservice will be routed to that thread. 
ii. Where as service by default runs in main thread. All the startservice requests will be routed to main thread by default.
iii. While implementing  a service, programmer has to implement onCreate(), onStartCommand(), and onDestroy() methods. 
iv. Where as while implementing IntentService programmer has to implement only onHandleIntent().
v. After starting IntentService, it will be automatically closed if there are no pending startService requests. 
vi. Where as for normal service programmer has to stop the service explicitly either by using stopSelf() or stopService() methods.
vii. Don't try to touch UI from IntentService's onHandleIntent() method directly, as that function runs in a separate thread. (Not in main thread).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Binder Service's onBind() function will be called only once for the first client. From there on wards for every client call to bind this service, android will cache that binder object and return it with out calling onBind() function.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
it is not a good practice to use started service if service wants to share some functionality with other components. binded services are far more faster and efficient than started service to share functionality with other components. it uses binders concept internally.
Note: Content providers are used to share data between 2 applications, not for sharing functionality.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
onCreate() -> onStartCommand() -> onDestroy(). This is the life cycle of a started service. onBind() and onUnbind() will come into picture for only binded services. previously in old versions onStart() was there in place of onStartCommand().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If you don't want to expose your service to outside apps, 3 ways are there. 1. Don't give intent-fiiter tag, so that outsiders can't specify intent action to trigger your service. or 2. User exported="false" in service tag, so that outside world cant trigger it. or 3. User local service manager.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
it is better to use services with thread, because threads in activity will have less priority compared to thread in a service in case if that activity is in background or stopped state. more over in case of low memory if it kills thread in activity, there is no way that android will recreate it. all these disadvantages are overcome in services with android. But still if you want to use a thread with activity then as long as programmer make sure that cleaning and creation of thread is done properly, then there won't be any problem.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
You can start service from any where, but still oncreate, onstartcommand runs in main thread only.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Update UI or toast from IntentService : What will happen if you try to touch UI or try to print a toast message from onHandleIntent() function of IntentService class ?
it behaves weirdly, either toast message may not appear or it appears and will be never removed. this happens because other threads can't touch UI with out informing to main thread.If you try to touch other UI components, it will crash.
IntentService onHandleIntent() functions runs in worker thread (not main thread). So don't try to touch UI elements from that function directly.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to move a service to foreground?
call startForeground(int id, Notification notification);
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If client and server are in different processes, then there are two ways to implement service. 1.creating a singled threaded server using Binder and Messenger or 2. Creating multi threaded server using aidls.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Binders won't use serialization concept for marshaling or converting data into byte streams. it uses Parcels instead.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If we want to create a service with multi threads and supports binders then we have to use .aidls and implement the stub.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
bindService() function is an asynchronous call which returns immediately. after returning, connection will be established after some time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Using binder services we can share below functionalities from binder service 1. Public methods of Binder extended class 2. Public methods of Service class, by returning this pointer of the Service class 3. Any other Service inner class's public functionalities by returning object to that class.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Below are the functionalities of Binder class. 
1.Marshaling & Un-marshaling of out gong and incoming data across the processes 
2. thread management for service class as incoming call from multiple clients may come from different threads. 
3. Binder's stub functionality has to be implemented by the programmer.

Menus are designed using xml, because menus will not change so frequently. You can build menus using code also when ever required. But it is not recommended to completely build menus using code.
Dialogs are built using code because dialog content will frequently change.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How many types of menus are there in android?
Options Menu - triggered when user presses menu hard key. This is deprecated starting from android 3.0. In place of options menu migrate to action bars.
Sub Menu - Menu with in a menu (only one level of sub menu is allowed). 
Context Menu - Triggered when user press and hold on some view which was registered to show context menu. 
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How many types of dialogues are there in android?
1. AlertDialog - This is the most common form of any dialog, which will contain title, text, and maximum 3 buttons.
    There in this 4 types of it - normal alert dialog, items alert dialog, single choice, & multi choice alert dialog. 
2. ProgressDialog. - This is to show progress bar in the dialog box.
3. DatePickerDialog - This is to show date to pick.
4. Time picker dialog - This is to show time to pick.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
getPreferences(0) - will open or create a preference file with out giving a name specifically. By default preference file name will be the current Activity name. if some one knows this, any once can access getPreference() file using that activity name. 
getSharedPreferences("name",0) - will open or create a preference file with the given name. If you want to create a preference file with a specific name then use this function. If you want multiple preference files for you activity, then also you can use this function.
Note: preferences file will be with .xml extension stored in data/data/preferences folder.

intent : is a message passing mechanism between components of android, except for content provider.
             you can use intents to pass data from one component to other component.
             you can also use intents to start one component from other component. eg: you can start an activity by using intents.
intent-filter : tells about the capabilities of that component.
            it tells what kind of implicit intents that component can handle. 
            intent-filters are counter parts for intents.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
local variables - declared in the function
class variables - declared in class, static
instance variables - declared in class which are non static
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
To make calls, we should have below permission tag in manifest file after </application> tag. 
<uses-permission android:name = "android.permission.CALL_PHONE"/>.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
src -> contains source code files
gen -> auto generated files by appt tool
bin -> contains .class and apk files
res -> contains all resource files
drawable -> contains images used for project
layouts -> contains layout xml designs
values -> contains strings xml files
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When programmer starts a component by using an intent, to trigger appropriate component android will perform 3 tests.

1.action test : the action string of intent should match with at least one action string of intent filter.
2.data test : data and data type of intent should match with that of intent filter.
3.category test : all the categories of intent should be there in intent filter.
                   note: In case of implicit intent starting an activity, then default category will be automatically added to intent.

If there is any component in manifest file with an intent filter which passes all the 3 tests, then android will trigger that component. Else not.
If there are multiple components satisfying that intent, and if it is not a broadcast receiver, then it will ask user to make a decision.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to trigger a component which don't have any action in the intent filter, from outside of that application?
No, with out any action no one can trigger or start that component from outside world.
Without any action in the intent filter, it is not possible to start that component from outside world.
intent filters, action will be considered only for implicit intents. 
Note: You can explicit intents only with in the application.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
intent-filters can have 0 - n number of actions, but if that component has only one intent-filter with 0 actions, then that component can be triggered using only explicit intents. a given intent-filter can have more than one action because, a given component can do more than one action. EG: notepad can perform two actions ACTION_VIEW & ACTION_EDIT on an existing note pad file.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Use getIntent() - then- getAction(). getIntent will give you the intent, from which you can fetch the action. but some times intent will be directly available in onNewIntent() function of the activity, in some scenarios. in that case you don't need to use getIntent() specifically.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
To access user name, pw & to show login status in dialog we need - one Activity with dialog. To connect to Gmail server we need - one Service, with one thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Where do static variables gets stored?
data segment
stack - stores local variables. heap - instance variables and new instances. data segment - will store all static variables. code segment - will store code.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
TextView is a predefined UI control given by android. If you don't like or wanted to enhance its properties, then you can create your own class by extending TextView class and implementing your own functionalities.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
shared preference files by default will be stored in internal memory of app. shared preference files extension is .xml. It is in the file structure of data/data/preferences. But this will not be visible to outside applications and phone users. they can't see what is available in apps internal memory allocated to it.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
By default if programmer don't give any name to shared preference, then activity name will be taken as shared preference file with .xml extension.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
For querying content provider which one to use, getWritabledatabase or getReadabledatabase?
use getReadableDatabase

Query() means reading the data. so getReadableDatabase() is sufficient.
If you are doing too many operations on database like querying, updating frequently in some random order, then it doesn't really make any sense in using getReadabledatabase as it can be used only to read the values.
Based on your app requirement you can judge the usage. If you are only reading the values constantly then you can go for getreadabledatabase.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When does onCreate() function of ContentProvider will be called?
onCreate() will be called when the application containing the content provider is loaded into the memory for the first time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the purpose of the ContentProvider class?
If you want to share the data of one application with the application then use content provider.
Note: We can start an Activity, a service, and a broadcast receiver by using intents. But you can't start or communicate with a content provider by using intents. If you want to communicate with content provider then you have to use content resolver.
1.content provider, and resolver will handle IPC(Inter process communication) mechanism when sharing data between 2 applications.
2.content provider has the capability to handle multiple threads, when queries are coming from multiple resolvers.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If you want to share the data across the all applications,you should go for ?
If you want to share the data of one application with the application then use content provider.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is cursor.moveToNext()?
It will move the cursor to point to next row if it is available, else it returns false.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What will happen if database is not closed properly after using it?
It will leak the memory. Once you are done with database we have to close it, because it will be cached into memory when we open it and eat up memory space.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to call getWritableDataBase() from onCreate() of ContentProvider?
getWritableDatabase() may take lot of time to create and update tables, so its better to differ this call to later point of time. because if we put this call in onCreate(), then application loading time will be increased and may irritate the user.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what are the mandatory functions to be implemented for a Content provider?
onCreate, insert, update, delete, query, getType are the mandatory functions to be implemented in Content Provider.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is android:authorities in content provider?
Authorities is main key or hint to Android on which content provider the query has to be redirected to. When clients pass URI, it will have authorities in it which should match with authorities part of provider tag.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is contentprovider and contentresolver? which of the below statements are true about them?
If you want to share the data of one application with the application then use content provider.
Only content resolver can communicate with content provider, from client application.
Note: We can start an Activity, a service, and a broadcast receiver by using intents. But you can't start or communicate with a content provider by using intents. If you want to communicate with content provider then you have to use content resolver.
 provider, and resolver will handle IPC(Inter process communication) mechanism when sharing data between 2 applications.
2.content provider has the capability to handle multiple threads, when queries are coming from multiple resolvers.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is UriMatcher in android content provider?
It is used for conversion logic or mapping logic from Uris to tables.It is similar to DNS, which converts URLs to IP addresses.
Note : Just like how we use URLs to connect to servers in the internet (eg: http://google.com for google server) similarly, in android if any application wants to access the data hold by other applications which is shared via content provider, the client application has to access it via URI (Uniform resource identifier). URI's looks exactly like an URL.
When client application access our database tables using URI, UriMatcher will map that URI to appropriate table.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When implementing a content provider, how to expose table URIs?
1.Create a separate interface file, which is accessible to out side world and put table URIs in that file.
2.Along with URIs we have to mention column names of all the tables, which we are exposing with URIs. 
3.Then we have to document in interface file about what is the data type of each column.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between Content provider and SQLite database? which one to use?
Use database if we want to store DB private to application, and for storing structured heavy data.
Use content provider if you want to share the data created by one application to other application.
DB is used to create tables private to application. You can access SQLite Database with in the application directly. Other applications can't directly touch the SQLite Database of a given application.If you want to share your database with other applications then use Content provider.
Content provider is used to share the data with other applications.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Which of the options are supported to be used with a content provider
To share data with other applications, data can be stored internally by using files, or databases, or through some network servers. Right now there is no support for SharedPreferences.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Where does the context is available in a Content Provider?
context will be available only from onCreate() of content provider.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to access context in content provider?
use getcontext() in oncreate() or use getApplicationContext().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android fetching contact details into application:
What does below code do?

Cursor c1 = this.getContentResolver().query(
                        ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);
if(c1 != null && c1.getCount() > 0)
{
  c1.moveToNext();
  String n = c1.getString(c1.getColumnIndex(Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME));
  ...
}
we are getting all rows of contacts table into a cursor, and fetching contact name from first row.

Explain the life cycle of an activity, in android?
Below cycle is always true.
onCreate-> onStart() -> onResume() -> onPause() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()

Description :

Explanation for android activity life cyle:

onCreate()
1.The system calls this when creating your activity.
2.You should initialize the essential components of your activity.
Eg:setcontentview
3.Using findviewbyid(), to programmatically interact with widgets in the UI
4.calling managedQuery
5.You can call finish()
6.If you want any thread running in the background to download DATA, you can   do it here. This has to be deleted in onDestroy()
7.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.

onStart() 
1.Called after onCreate(Bundle)  or after onRestart() followed by onResume().
2.you can register a BroadcastReceiver in onStart() to monitor changes that impact your UI, You hav to unregister it in onStop()
3.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.

onResume()
1.Called after onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle), onRestart(), or onPause()
2.begin animations, open exclusive-access devices (such as the camera)

onPause ()
1.Called as part of the activity lifecycle when an activity is going into the background
2.The counterpart to onResume().
3.B will not be created until A's onPause() returns. (So donâ€™t do anything long here)
4.Save all your persistent data here.
5.Good place to do things like stop animations (any CPU consuming things), to make switching to other activity as soon as possible. 
6.Close your camera here if it is opened
7.Eg: if device goes to sleep or some dialog is displayed, then it will go to onPause().
8.onStop() will follow this function, once the other waiting activity resumes and started displaying on the scree. This is not guaranteed as in some cases onResume() will be called with out onStop().
9.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.

onStop ()
1.Called when you are no longer visible to the user
2.You will next receive either onRestart(), onDestroy()
3.this method may never be called, in low memory situations
4.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.

onDestroy ()
1.Perform any final cleanup before an activity is destroyed
2.do not count on this method being called as a place for saving data!
3.This method is usually implemented to free resources like threads that are associated with an activity,
4.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown

onRestart ()
1.Called after onStop() when the current activity is being re-displayed to the user
2.It will be followed by onStart() and then onResume()
3.If you have deactivated any cursor in onStop(), call managedQuery() again.
4.Derived classes must call through to the super class's implementation of this method. If they do not, an exception will be thrown.

onSaveInstanceState â€“ this is where we have to save transient state of the application
onRestoreInstanceState â€“ this is where we have to restore the transient state of our application that has been crashed due to low memory scenarios.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In Activity's onCreate function, What is the purpose of super.oncreate() ?
Every activity should inherit from Activity class.

Activity base class provides 3 basic functions for every screen:
1.It provides empty graphical window on which you can load your designed screen.
2.Activity Base Class will handle all the UI events which are not handled by programmer.
3.Activity Base Class will handle transition states of your activity, when you are moving from one activity to other activity.

super.onCreate:
When you call super.onCreate it will provide empty graphical window on which you can load your screen.
If you comment super.oncreate(); then it will crash your program because there is no container to load your screen.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it mandatory to implement oncreate() & onstart() of activity life cycle ? Will it run if those life cycle methods are removed?
nothing will happen it will run perfectly
It is a standard, that programmer has to implement corresponding life cycles methods of activity based on the functionality supported. But one can skip those functions if programmer wish to.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to have an Activity without UI?
yes, if it is doing some functionality with out UI
Generally every activity will have UI (User Interface) screens. But if programmer wants he can omit UI and do some background functionality with an Activity. 
Note: To do background functionality its better to use service than an activity with out UI. It makes more sense.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to start an activity to get response? Or How to start an activity to get result?
startActivityForResult(Intent intent) is the function to use to start an activity, which returns some result to you on finishing itself.

Start Activity for Result():
We will use this function if we are expecting some result from child activity.
Start Activity for result will take two parameters:
1.Intent.
2.Integer Request code (it is a integer constant)

Returning Results form ChildActivity:
If you want to return success to the parent activity then use below functions.
setResult(RESULT_OK); and then finish();
Once you set the result then you have to immediately call finish function.

To return failure:
setResult(RESULT_CANCELED); and then finish();
In case if child activity crashes due to some reason then it will automatically pass RESULT_ CANCELED.

How to catch the results from the child in the parent activity:
For this we have to implement a function called onActivityResult(â€¦â€¦) in parent activity.
OnActivityResult() function has 3 paramaters
 1.Request code
 2.Result code
 3.Intent.

Activity life cycle: When a new activity comes on top of your activity completely, then what is the life cycle function that gets executed in the old activity?
When new activity comes on top of an existing activity, then existing activity will move to invisible state by calling onPause() -> then -> onStop. If top activity is transparent or doesn't occupy complete screen, then below activity's onStop() will not be called.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When a dialog comes on top of an existing activity, then existing activity will move to partially invisible state by calling onPause().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

What are the data storage options in android? Note: persistent data.
Persistent data means permanent data, so use files, databases, sharedpreferences, and network servers to store persistent data. Arrays can hold only temporary data.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android ANR(Application Not Responding) : What is the UI response time limit in android. (I.E with in how many seconds main thread has to respond to user actions?)
5 sec
If user touches your activity, and if your program doesn't respond to user events with in 5 seconds, android will not tolerate it and it force closes your application. this error is called as ANR (Application Not Responding).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the intent-filter of main activity that launches your application's main screen?
<intent-filter>

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>

action.MAIN - says this activity is the main activity (starting point) for this application. 
category.LAUNCHER - says this activity should appear in the home screen's launcher.

    }
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Activity life cycle: What is the mandatory activity life cycle function that will get called in case of configuration changes?
In case of low memory or configuration changes, android will call both onPause() and onSaveInstanceState() with out fail. Exception: there is one exceptional case, that is if programmer is handling configuration changes, then in that case it will not call those functions.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Activity life cycle onStop: Can I save all my databse table updates in onStop() of activity? If not explain why and also explain where should I save db tables?
No, because onStop() may not be called in some situations.
In case of low memory or configuration changes, there is a chance that android may force-kill your application before reaching onStop(). onPause() is the only function that will be called with out fail before killing the application. so save all persistent data like DB tables in onPause() only.
Note : We can't save all database tables in onSaveInstanceState, because that function will not be called if user presses back button.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is difference between persistent data and transient data?


Persistent data is permanent data that we store, eg in database tables, and transient data is logical data that we use in programming logic.
Persistent data means permanent, and transient means temporary.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What will happen if super.oncreate() from oncreate() function of activity is commented?
Run time exception, super not called.
All activity's life cycle functions have to call super class methods, as super class Activity will do lot of helping functionalities for derived class. If you don't call it will throw run time exception.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
this pointer always points to current class object, app context will point to entire process. there is only one app context. if you want to use some control whose life time is through out your application life time then go for app context, else use this pointer (activity context).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Where to register broadcast receivers that updates UI? If I have a broadcast receiver that updates my UI frequently, then where should I register that broadcast receiver in my activity life cycle functions?
onStart() function will be called just before your activity will be made visible to the user. So any thing that affects UI has to be registered in onStart() function.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Save image in onsaveinstatncestate: A heavy image downloaded from internet in onCreate() of an activity. Is it possible to save it in onsaveinstancestate() in case of configurationChanges?
no, we have to use some static reference to it.
Generally configuration changes causes activity to get destroyed and recreated. So if you have downloaded heavy image from internet in onCreate() function, then there is a chance that it will be re downloaded in onCreate() one more time if user rotates the phone. To avoid this we can have a static reference to that image to avoid multiple downloads.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
An application is having one broadcast receiver - whose onReceive() is currently executing, service - is in running state; then what is that process priority?
foreground process(1)
Receiver which is executing its onReceive() will be treated with highest priority. process priority will be the maximum of components priority. So in this case process priority is highest priority.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is broadcastreceiver in android?
It is a component of android which responds to system wide broadcast announcments.
It acts like a gateway between outside world and your application.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Broadcast receiver runs in which thread, by default?
Default every component of android will run in Main thread (UI thread). So broadcast receiver also runs in main thread by default.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What will happen if broad cast receiver binds to binder service? Is there any problem?
No, One should not bind a service from Broadcast receiver because, broadcast receivers will have a time limit of 10 seconds. establishing connection to a service may take more time.
One should not bind a service from Broadcast receiver. The reason is broadcast receivers are light weight components, where it has to finish its functionality with in not more than 10 seconds maximum. Else android may forcefully kill your receiver. Binding (establishing connection to) a service may take more than 10 seconds in some worst cases, that's why android won't allow it.

Rules for Broadcast Receivers:

1.Broadcast receivers will not have any UI(mostly) and it will have only background logic.
2.Broadcast receivers will have the maximum time limit of 10 sec to finish its functionality otherwise it will crash.
3.You should not do long running operations or asynchronous operations in the receiver. 
Example: a. Preparing SD card. b. Uploading / Downloading files from internet. c. Creating Db files. d. Binding to services
4.Do not show dialog to the user in broadcast receiver. (this is asynchronous operation)
5.You can use a toast or Notifications.
6.Don"t write any heavy functionalities.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to start a service from a broadcast receiver?
yes can start using startService() function
Any component can communicate with other component. only exception for this rule is don't bind to a service from a broad cast receiver. other wise one is free to start a service.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between broadcast receiver and a service?
BroadcastReceiver - is like gateway for other components, can do small back ground functionality with in 10 seconds. Services - can do long running operation in the background with out having UI, and no time limit for it.but both receiver and service both can interact with UI if they want to. services will not have time limit of 10 seconds, receivers respond to broadcasted messages.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to start a broadcast receiver on phone boot completed?
<receiver >

    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the time limit of a broadcast receiver, what will happen if it crosses that time limit?
Broad cast Receiver is a component that responds to system wide broad cast announcements. It acts as gateway to other components of our application. It is not supposed to do long running operation, it has to do its operation in 10 seconds maximum.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between sendbroadcast(), sendorderedbroadcast(), sendstickybroadcast() ?
sendbroadcast() - normal broadcast, but we can set priority as well.
sendorderedbroadcast() - we can set priority, and set result. can block broadcasts as well.
sendstickybroadcast() - intent passed with this will be stick for future users
Description :
sendbroadcast() - normal broadcast, but we can set priority as well.

sendorderedbroadcast() - we can set priority, and set result. can block broadcasts as well.
In the ordered broadcast you can predict the order of broadcast receiver using priority in the intent_ Filter.
1.If the priority is same for two receivers then order cannot be predicted.
2.In the ordered broadcast you can also pass data between two receivers.
3.You can also abort the broadcast anywhere in between the receivers.

sendstickybroadcast() - intent passed with this will be stick for future users who are registering through code (dynamic receivers).
When somebody sends a sticky broadcast using send stickyBroadcast(in); then that broadcast will be available for the future users who are using dynamic receivers.
This broadcast will be available for only Dynamic Broadcast rx who are coming in future.
Eg for stickybroadcast is - BATTERY LOW.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the life cycle of a broadcast receiver in android?
there is only one function in broad cast receiver, that is onReceive(). Broadcast receiver's life will start before calling onReceive() method, and once control comes out of onReceive() method, then it will be killed.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
To notify something to the user from a broadcast receiver, should I use dialogs or notifications? Why?
Broadcast receivers are light weight components, which has to finish off its functionality with in time limit of 10 seconds. if we show dialog to user, there is a chance that user may take more than 10 seconds to respond to it by chance. in that case receiver may crash or may not be available to take dialog input from user. So it is always a standard and good practice to use notifications from a receiver.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create a receiver without registering it in manifest file?
We can register receiver dynamically in code.
Every component has to get registered in the manifest file. But there is an exception for this rule, a broad cast receiver can get registered dynamically in code. Because there may be some scenarios where we need handle broad casted messages only when our application is running. If we register it in manifest file statically, then even if our app is not running, it may trigger our broad cast receiver.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to send BATTERY_LOW broadcast? should I use sendbroadcast() or sendstickybroadcast? Why?
use sendStickyBroadCast(), because logically this broadcast has to be available for future users.
Description : We have to use sendStickyBroadCast() because, logically if battery went down, then this information has to be available for applications which may run after some time in future.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How set an alarm to trigger after two days? how to implement it? assume that user may switch off the phone in between.
Use AlarmManager and call set() to set after 2 days. If phone switched off, all alarms will be dead. So, before switching off maintain all alarms details in Data Base and recreate all alarms after switching on.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Trigger broadcast receiver only if my activity is in memory, else it should not get triggered, how to do it?
If you want to trigger broadcast receiver as long as activity is in memory, then go for dynamic receiver which gets registered only when activity comes into memory. and unregister it before killing your activity.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
px - is meant for absolute pixels. This is used if you want to give in terms of absolute pixels for width or height. Not recommended.

dp/ dip - both mean same, density independent pixels. This is alternative of px. Generally we never use px because it is absolute value. If you use px to set width or height, and if that application is being downloaded into different screen sized devices, then that view will not stretch as per the screen original size. dp is highly recommended to use in place of px.
   Use dp if you want to mention width and height to grow & shrink dynamically based on screen sizes.   
   if we give dp/dip, android will automatically calculate the pixel size on the basis of 160 pixel sized screen.
sp - Scale independent pixels. when mentioning the font sizes to fit for various screen sizes, use sp. This is similar to dp.Use sp especially for font sizes to grow & shrink dynamically based on screen sizes.
dpi- dots per inch. It is the resolution factor. More the dpi better and higher the screen resolution.

Math logic behind it:
1dp = 1px in 160 dpi screen. Means 1 dp is equal to 1physical px of a device having 160 dots per inch.
so no of dynamic pixles for a given dp is = (dp's)*(density/160).
For example on 240dpi screen 1dp = 1.5px (physical pixels)

Activity can be killed programatically in two ways. finish() or finishActivity(int requestcode). 
finish() - can be used by an activity to kill itself. 
finishActivity(int requestcode) -  Force finish another activity that you had previously started with startActivityForResult(Intent intent, int requestcode); This function will let the parent activity to kill the child activity, which it has started previously.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Configuration change : is either orientation change(phone rotation), or language settings change.

onPause() -> onSaveInstanceState() -> onCreate() -> onStart() -> onRestoreInstanceState() -> onResume()
onPause() -> onSaveInstanceState() -> onStop() -> onCreate() -> onStart() -> onRestoreInstanceState() -> onResume()
onPause() -> onSaveInstanceState() -> onStop() -> onDestroy()->onCreate() -> onStart() -> onRestoreInstanceState() -> onResume()

In case of configuration change, android will forcefully kill your activity and recreates it, unless you are not handling configuration changes on your own programmatically.
When android kills your activity due to configuration changes, it makes sure that it will definitely call onPause() and onSaveInstanceState. But there is no guarantee about call onStop and onDestroy. But android documentation doesn't say that it will not call onStop and onDestroy. it depends.
Life cycle in the case of configuration changes can be any of the option 1, or 2, or 3, based on the situation. some times it might not kill activity at all if programmer is handling configuration changes programmatically, which is not a standard way to do.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
two types of linear layouts are available. horizontal & vertical.
Linear Layout:  Linear layout can have only two orientations either vertical or horizontal.It will align the child views in the linear fashion either vertically or horizontal.

By default linear layouts will use horizontal, if you don't specify any orientation.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Activity life cycle: Why you should not do heavy functionality in onPause()  of your activity?
because user is eagerly waiting for next activity to show up
onPause() will be called as the first indication that user is moving away from your activity, that means intentionally user is moving to next screen, so more the time you hold control in onPause() more it will irritate user. so don't hold control here for too much of time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Activity life cycle: What to do in onRestart() of an activity?
if any UI changes happened while it is in invisible state, updated it in this function
onRestart() will be called, after onStop(). when onStop is called it means your activity is in invisible state, during that time if any ui changes happens which is not visible to user, update all those changes to user in onRestart()

what are the mandatory functions to be implemented in custom adapter?
getCount(), getView(), getItem(), getItemId()
If one is implementing custom adapter by extending BaseAdapter, then he or she has to give implementation of all 4 functions mentioned getView(), getItem(), getCount(), getItemId().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create a custom adapter in Android? What is the class that I need to extend to create my own adapter?
Extend Either one of the conceret Adapters or BaseAdapter
To create a own custom adapter, one can extend BaseAdapter, or can extend any of the existing concrete adapters like ArrayAdapter, SimpleCursorAdatper etc.. 
Note: we can also extend or implement other adapter interfaces, but it is not so useful. Generally extending BaseAdapter is enough to create our own custom adapter.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is an adapter in android?
bridge between source and adapter views
Adapter Design Patterns:

1. If destination is expecting one kind of input and source is giving one kind of input then we have to use adapters to convert source into destination.
2. Whenever you change the source we have to use a different kind of adapter.
   adapter design pattern is used for bridging between source and adapter views. 

Functionalities of Adapter:
It takes the input from source and gives to the destination.

ADAPTER VIEW:
  Any view that is getting input from any adapter is called as Adapter View.
  List view is an example of adapter view.
  List view generally will contain vertically scrollable list of items.

NOTE: Source should not directly communicate with destination (Adapter view).

FUNCTIONALITIES OF ADAPTERS IN AANDROIDANDROIDNDROID:

 1. Adapters will take inputs from source and gives to the destination.
 2. If there is any change in the source and if we notify to the adapter then     adapter will go and modify the destination.
 3. Adapter will take each data item from source and prepare a view and     dispatches that view to the destination.

Examples for adapters:
eg1 : If you want to display data from array list into listview, then we use arrayadapter in android.
eg2 : if you want to display data from database into a listview, then we use cursoradapter in android.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is an adapterview? How many adapter views are available in android?
any view that takes input from adapter is called as adapter view. eg:listview, gallery, spinner, gridview, etc..
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When activity is destroyed, will it be in memory or moved out of it?
A destroyed application will be removed from memory if it is not frequently visited by user. because, if user is visiting an app frequently, then it has to be loaded many times.
Description : Generally after calling onDestroy(), app will be removed from memory. But there is an exception for this rule. If user is visiting an app very frequently then it has to be loaded into memory very frequently. to avoid this over head for the system, android may choose to keep that app in memory even after onDestroy(). This is called "empty process". Process which is killed but still in memory.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When we press home button any activity, that will be moved to back ground state (invisible state), so it calls onStop() on that activity
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is Bundle? What does it contain in onCreate() of your activity?
Bundle contain previous savedInstantceState

Description :

Bundle is a data holder, which holds data to be passed between activities.
In case of forceful closing of an activity, android will save all its UI states and transient states so that they can be used to restore the activity's states later. This saved states will be passed via Bundle in onCreate() function to restore its states once android recreates a killed activity. 
EG: this will happen in case of low memory or configuration changes like rotating the phone.

onSaveInstanceState():
This function will be called by aAndroidAndroidndroid before â€œompauseâ€ or after â€œonpauseâ€ if aAndroidAndroidndroid is forcefully killing your activity. In this function we have to save all your activity states.

onRestoreInstanceState():
This function will be called after "onStart".

how to handle key events in android? What is the key event flow?
Keyevents will flow from Activity to UI view. But Activity will never block event flow, but if it is required UI View can block some event to stop Activity to handle it. Programmer also can block any Key event to stop UI View to handle it.
Description : Key events will flow like this: Android system -> Activity -> Layout -> View -> programmer. First priority will be given programmer written logic, if programmer has written some thing to handle some key events it will be execute first. From there based on the return statement it will decide to flow back that key event to parent or not. eg: if programmer choose to block some key say KEYCODE_0, then for that key code he can say return true; which will block that event and will be destroyed in programmers function only.

How to start a content provider using an intent?
not possible. Using intent you can't trigger a content provider. because, we use content resolver to communicate with content provider
Intents will be used to communicate or start components of android. Only exception is content provider. You can start an activity, service, and a broadcast receiver using intent but not content provider. For content provider we have to use content resolver to communicate.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Content Provider is used to share an application's data with other applications. Right now there is no support for shared preferences with content provider.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
content provider is used to share private data with other applications, where as content-resolver communicates from client end with content provider.
Description : DB, Files, preferences are stored in private memory of application which cannot be accessed by outside applications.content provider is used to share this private data with other applications.
Where as contentresolver is used to communicate with content provider from client application. 
As of now there is no support for shared preferences with content provider.

By default databases and files are stored in internal memory, but it is also possible to store it in sd card also. But it is not suggestible to store it on sd card, as user and other applications can directly access and may lead to data inconsistency when others changes it directly.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
All options preferences, files, and sqlite default will be stored in private memory of application. but if you want to store heavy data prefer SQLite instead of other two, as SQLite is very efficient and fast when you are reading or inserting or updating your information.
Note: As you know that DBMS is always faster than file systems. SQLite is a DBMS.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Why we have to create and upgrade database only in SQLiteOpenHelper?
Because SQLiteOpenHelper will make sure that database is always in sensible state. Also it manages the threads if more than one thread is trying to touch DB.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Creating helper object is synchronous which returns immediately, where as getWritableDatabase may take time when you are creating db for the first time. So it may take more time (asynchronous) for the first time or when we are upgrading the database.

What is the difference between service and a thread?
Service - is a component of android, which runs in the background with out any UI. By default service will run in Main thread only. Thread - is not android component, but still one can use thread to do some background task. Using thread in place of service is discouraged.
Description :
Service : is a component of android which performs long running operation in the background, mostly with out having UI.
Thread : is a O.S level feature that allow you to do some operation in the background.
Though conceptually both looks similar there are some crucial differentiation.
1.Service - if it is destroyed while performing its job, in the middle by Android due to low memory scenario. Then android will make sure that it will restart your service, if you have returned START_STICKY or START_REDELIVER_INTENT from onStartCommand().
2.Thread - if it is destroyed by android in middle due to low memory, then android will not guarantee to restart it again. That means user lost his half work. 
3.Service - is a component of android, so it has priority levels to be considered while destroying an application due to low memory. Thread- is not a component of android, so android will not take thread priority into consideration while killing an application due to low memory.
I will try to explain this 3rd point.
Lets say you have a requirement of connecting to internet from your activity. You can do it by using a service(with thread) or directly by creating a thread in activity. Consider the second scenario where you are connecting to internet in a thread. Then
i. What will happen if user closes the activity, while still thread is running in the background. Will that thread continue to run in back ground ? Answer is you can't really predict.
ii.Assume that in continuation for above scenario, even after killing activity your thread continued to do its intended operation. Then there is a low memory situation arises in your phone. Then this application will be the first susceptible app to be killed as there is no priority for this application.
So bottom line is: If you want to do some heavy background functionality then it is always better to have a service with thread. If you feel that that background functionality to be alive as long as your activity is alive, then go for activity with thread or activity with async task.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
start a service from activity and close activity, what will happen to that service, will it be alive or dead?
service will be keep running in the background, even if the activity which has created is no more alive.But it can stop itself when the work given to it is done. Or others also can kill that service using stopService(), or android also can kill the service forcefully in case of low memory scenarios.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to stop a service in android?
One can stop a service using 1.stopSelf() or 2.stopService(). There are some situations where android may also kill running services in case if it requires memory and phone is running out of memory(low memory).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Bound service : binding to a service, what is the function that needs to be implemented in service class?
to implement a binded service one has to implement onBind(), onUnBind() functions in service class and onServiceConnected() in client side class.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create a service with multiple threads in it?
Create a service with creating thread in onStartCommand. Or simply use asynctask in the service.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to update UI from a service that has threads?
Since updating UI from other thread directly is not possible, communicate with Main UI thread for the UI updates
Description : Android follows singled threaded UI model, i.e other threads should not touch UI with out taking permission of Main UI thread. If other threads wants to touch UI, communicate it to Main thread. Many ways are there to achieve it, use 1. RunOnUiThread() 2. use Handlers to communicate to main thread 3. Use AsyncTask and update ui from onPre or onPost or onProgress ..
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to start a service with foreground priority?
startForeground (int id, Notification notification), use this function in onCreate() of your service.
Description : Generally services will run in background, which is of 3rd priority. if you feel that the service is critical for user, then you can increase its priority by making it foreground service. Use function startForeground (int id, Notification notification), in onCreate() of your service to make this service as foreground service.
Foreground services will be treated with highest priority, so android will ensure it will not kill these services even in case of low memory situations. Eg: MP3 player service is a foreground service.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Service with threads: My application has only a service, and my service performs heavy lift functionality to connect to internet and fetch data, now should I create a thread or not? If so why?
No need to create a new thread in Service as it is not required in this scenario. Because service runs in the main thread. Since our app doesn't have any activities, so its OK to run service in main thread. ANR error will occur only if activities and services runs in same thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Services are possible with single thread and multiple threads also. If you want multi threaded service, then write thread creation logic in onStartCommand() because this function will be called every time some one starts the service. if you want single threaded service then create thread in onCreate() of service class. Multi threaded services are also possible with AsyncTasks.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to pass data from activity to service?
pass data in intent-putextras, and say startService() with that intent
store it in common database and access it through both activity and service.
There are many ways to do it. one straight forward way is pass data in intent-putextras, and say startService() with that intent. 
one more way is store it in common database or shared preference file and access it through both activity and service.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Updating UI from service: How to access progress bar from a service?
If you want to touch UI from service, trigger a dynamically registered receiver in activity from service. And update UI from that dynamic receiver with in that activity.
Description : Both option 1 is wrong way of communication design. all UI controlling has to be done in activity to reduce side effects. if a services wants to touch UI, send a broadcast from service which triggers a receiver in activity which is dynamically registered in activity for communication. from that receiver you can touch UI since it is inner class of it.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between startservice and bindservice?
started service - runs in background for ever unless some one or itself stops. it is used to perform long running operation. Binded service -  is alive as long as some one binds to it and interacts with it. binded services can return value to the person who bound to it.
Description : Started service - is used to do some long running operation in the back ground. it will be alive in memory even if the person who started it is no longer in memory. either it itself can stop or some other also can stop it. generally services will not have UI. it is used to some back ground functionalities like sending SMS, downloading files, etc..   
Binded service- is like a client server architecture where clients can request to binded service to execute some function and return the result. started services will not return results generally. since data flow happens from service to client, there should be communication channel in the case of binded services.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What are the various return values of onStartCommand() , and when to use what?
START_STICKY - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then restart service by sending intent null
START_NOT_STICKY - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then don't restart service, until user restarts it.
START_REDELIVER_INTENT - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then restart service by sending re-sending the intent.
START_STICKY - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then restart service by sending intent null. START_NOT_STICKY - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then don't restart service, until user restarts it. START_REDELIVER_INTENT - in case if android stops our service forcefully, then restart service by re-sending the intent.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to monitor service connection status in bound services?
using onServiceDisConnected(),  this function will be called if connection is broken
Description : client has to implement ServiceConnection object, to monitor the connection status between client and service. if service connection is broken, android will automatically call onServiceDisconnected() function of ServiceConnection object.
If service is connected then android will automatically call onServiceConnected() function of ServiceConnection object.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Bound service: Letâ€™s say my service supports both starting a service and binding a service, and currently two persons have started my service and one person is binding to my service. After 5 minutes person who bound to my service, unbinds it.And other person stops my service, now is my service running in memory or got moved out from memory?
Service is dead and moved out of memory
Description : Even if one client says stopService(), then service will be dead and moved out of memory if there are no binded connections are no other startService() requests pending to be processed.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to implement IPC (Inter process communication) using binders?

4. return object to this stub class from onBind()
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Service or thread: To do background functionality in activity, is it better to start service or thread? why?
If that background functionality is co-related with activity, then use thread. else launch it in a new service with thread in the service.
Description : It always depends on the requirement. if the background functionality is related or tightly coupled with activity, then use thread. but if you want some thing to do in background irrespective of whether activity is alive or not, then go for service-with thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to have a service without any thread?
yes, you can have service running in main thread is O.K only if you are not running any activity in Main thread.
Service is a component that performs some operation in the background with out having UI. But it doesn't mean that it will have separate thread to do it. By default if programmer doesn't provide any thread for the service, then it runs in Main UI thread. Since it is not good practice to run Activity & Services in single thread, it is suggestible to have separate thread for the service, except in few cases like where a given application is not having any activity in it.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What will happen if you start a service with out any thread, that does heavy functionality?
ii. May lead to ANR (application not responding) error some times, but that is applicable if your application is having at least one activity, since that activity will run in UI thread.
Since android gives only one thread per application, default all activities will run in that thread. but service also performs long running operations in the background, it is not suggestible to run service also in the same thread which may hang your activities which lead to ANR.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In case of low memory if android closes a service forcefully, then will it restart automatically or user has to start that service?
It will never be restarted again by Android only if programmer has not returned START_NOT_STICKY from onStartCommand()
If android has stopped service with out user's knowledge, then it is the responsibility of android to restart it. But this rule will not be applicable if programmer returns START_NOT_STICKY from onStartCommand().

HTTP : What is true about HTTP response status code coming from server to android application?
Response status code >=400 means error, else success.
Note : as a simple example, status code 404 is an error "page not found". So error codes are always > 400.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What will happen if HTTP Connection code is written in activity's Main thread?
It wont give any error, but may lead to ANR till 2.3 version. but from 3.0 it is mandatory that all network connections has to happen in separate worker thread. else it will crash at run time with NetworkOnMainThreadException
If we don't use separate background thread from 3.0 version on wards, system will throw run time exception.
The purpose of Main UI thread is to take care of all UI events coming to the screen from the user. All UI is under control of Main thread.
Connecting to internet is a heavy functionality. Basic android rule says don't do more than 1 heavy functionality in Main UI thread. Because it affects UI responsiveness and it may lead to ANR (Application Not Responding) error at run time.
Connecting to internet in main thread, wont give any error till 2.3 version but may lead to ANR at run time. 
From 3.0 it is mandatory that all network connections has to happen in separate worker thread else it throws run time exception.
Exception name is : NetworkOnMainThreadException

How to send or receive data between android application and a remote server? Which of the below mechanisms are fast to send the data ?
If the data is very small, then use NameValuePairs. And if the data is heavy structured data, then use JSON. Because JSON is lighter than xml so transferring speed will be fast. JSON can be easily transferred to javascript object compared to XML, so its preferred to use json.
Note : JSON will get lot of advantage over xml especially when used with AJAX kind of technology which refreshes page content dynamically with out reloading entire page.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

What is GCM?
Google Cloud Messaging for chrome (GCM) is a service for signed-in Chrome users that helps developers send message data from servers to their Chrome apps and extensions. The service is intended to wake up an app or extension, and/or alert a user. For example, calendar updates could be pushed to users even when their calendaring app isn't open.
Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) is a service that allows you to send data from your server to your users' Android-powered device, and also to receive messages from devices on the same connection.
GCM is a faster mechanism to push data (light weight) from your web server to all your client mobile devices at a time with free of cost. It is a framework deisgned by Google to support faster and free data transimission between server to mobile deives that is powerd by android. This is a 2 way communication channel that allows even android devices to send the data to the web server via GCM framework. This is really useful to the start up companies who can't afford high bandwidth communication rates to the mobile clients to communicate.

What is the difference between view and viewgroup in android?
View is a basic building block of UI (User Interface) in android. A view is a small rectangular box which responds to user inputs. Eg: EditText, Button, CheckBox, etc..
ViewGroup is a invisible container of other views (child views) and other viewgroups. Eg: LinearLayout is a viewgroup which can contain other views in it.
ViewGroup is a special kind of view which is extended from View as its base class. ViewGroup is the base class for layouts.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between margin and padding in android?
Margin specifies the extra space left on all four sides of a view. Margin space is generally outside the view's bounds. To leave space on left side use android:margin_left, to leave space on other sides use android:layout_marginRight, android:layout_marginTop, android:layout_marginBottom etc..
Padding is used to offset the content of a view by specifying pixels. For example a left padding of 2 wil push views content 2 pixels right side of the left edge. Use android:padding
    android:paddingBottom
    android:paddingLeft
    android:paddingRight
    android:paddingTop to set padding on various sides of the content of that view.

How does android achieve seamlessness. What is the meaning of seamlessness?
by handling onSaveInstanceState. Seamlessness means uninterrupted flow of application.
by handling configuration changes, seamless meaning is same as option 1
by handling low memory scenarios, seamlessness meaning is same as 1.
seamlessness means un-interrupted flow of an application. No matter what is happening to your application, user should not feel that disturbance. these disturbances may happen in case of low memory, and configuration changes where android will and recreate the activity. but these changes should not be visible to the user and should not disturb user. this can be done by handling these conditions in onSaveInstantnceState() in all activities.

What does the flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK do here?
Intent in = new Intent();
in.setAction("com.android.myproject.MYACTION");
in.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
startActivity(in);

It will start a new activity with matching intent filter, in a new task only if that corresponding task is not in memory now.
Description from developer android documentation:
If this flag is set, then this activity will become the start of a new task on this history stack.
When using this flag, if a task is already running for the activity you are now starting, then a new activity will not be started; instead, the current task will simply be brought to the front of the screen with the state it was last in. 
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What does the flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_INSTANCE do here?
Intent in = new Intent();

What is activity animation in android?
Applying transition and scaling animations while moving from one activity to other activity is called as activity animation, to make it appear as if they are sliding and zooming in and out.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is activity transition animation in android? How to do activity transition animation?

    A Transition is a mechanism to automatically animate changes that occur when a new scene is entered.

    When a transition is applied while moving from one activity to other activity, then new activity will appear as if it is sliding from right to left. While moving in the new activity, you can apply some animation to old activity to apear as if it is fading out by using alpha.

    A sample code:

    Go to resources->anim folder-> create opening_trans.xml

    <set xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
        <translate android:fromXDelta="100%"

Assume that two dates are d1, and d2.

1-	long dif_dates = d1.getTime() - d2.getTime();
	long secs = dif_dates / 1000;
	long mins = seconds / 60;
	long hours = minutes / 60;
	long days = hours / 24;

2-	assume that you have two dates secondDate and firstDate.
	long dateDif = secondDate.getTime() - firstDate.getTime();
	long difference = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSeconds(dateDif);

But second option gives difference in terms of seconds, where as first one in terms of days, hours.

Description : Before loading an application into RAM, a process will be created with a thread by default. Even though in Linux, an application will be given only one process to run all its components, it is quite possible that components of a given application can run in more than one process provided both processes have same Linux user id.

Is it possible to send a message from thread-a to thread-b, if thread-b didn't prepare its looper?
if thread-a wants to send a message to thread-b, then thread-b's looper should be prepared to retrieve message send by others.it is also possible with HandlerThread to have inter-thread communication.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to update UI from other threads? Note : Other thread means other than main thread.
Request Main Thread through inter thread communication using Handlers or runOnUiThread() function, and manipulate ui
Description : All Ui controls or views will be under control of Main thread (UI thread). If other thread wants to touch UI, it is possible through one of the inter thread communication, that is through handlers or through runOnUiThread() function or through asynctask.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create a service with one thread in it?
Create a service with one thread in OnCreate().
Use Intent Service
If you want  a service with one thread, then go for IntentService, or a normal service with a thread in onCreate().
onCreate will be called only once, so if you create a thread there, then it will become a service with single thread.
But make sure that from onStartCommand you are queuing up the requests to that thread using some handlers.
Even if you use IntentService also, that will also create only one thread in that service. Using IntentService is a good option to go for a service with single thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
By default a given process(application) will have how many threads? Who will create those threads?
main thread created by android system
Since every process requires a thread to run with CPU, by default android system will create one main thread for every application
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Does android support multitasking? How multitasking works in android, explain how to start a new task when you are already running a task?
Android supports multitasking at app level also. That means you can create apps with multitasking capability. One way to achieve multitasking is press home button on current task which will move it to background and then you can start new task from launcher.Another way is use FLAG_NEW_TASK in the intent, when you are starting a new activity.
Note: User can press and hold home button to see all the starting activities of recent tasks he has visited. From there also user can switch to other tasks by selecting any of those activities.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Does android support multi threading?
Yes it supports both multitasking and multi-threading. User can launch multiple applications at a time and can switch between those applications (this is called as multitasking). In a given application we can have multiple threads which can run simultaneously (this is called as multi-threading).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the mechanism used by android for Inter-process-communication?
Searialization
Parceling
Binders
can use any of above mechanisms, but using serialization in android is not suggestible because it delays IPC mechanism.
Description : IPC means Inter process communication : Where two applications or processes will communicate with each other by passing some data between them.
Since android is meant for embedded and small devices, we should not use serialization for IPC, rather we can use BINDERs which internally uses parcels. parcel is a sort of light weight serialization by using shared memory concept.
There are many differences between Binder IPC and Serialization IPC:
1. Serialization is very heavy to use in embedded devices, communication will be very slow.
2. Binders uses Parcels to make IPC very fast.
3. Binders internally uses Shared memory concept which uses less memory while sharing data between two processes.
Bottom line : Binders uses less memory, and quite fast as it uses parcels. Serialization is very heavy , takes time to send and receive data, and also it takes more memory compared to binders.
Note : To pass data between activities, services, and receivers use only Bundles. Don't go for either serialization or binders. Binders are specifically used only for binder services where 2 processes will communicate.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How binder is different from serialization?
Binder uses shared memory concept to do Inter process communication
Serialization and Binders are both IPC mechanisms how to processes will communicate. Serialization is very heavy as it has to copy hole data and transmit to other process through channel. But Binders are light weight where both the processes will share or communicate the data using a shared memory concept. what ever the data has to be shared it will be kept in a common shared memory and both process's can access that memory to make communication faster.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to touch UI from background thread directly? What will happen if I do so?
Android follows single threaded UI model, so other threads can't touch UI.  but other thread can touch UI through handlers [or] runOnUIThread() methods
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How Android inter thread communication works?
Possible through only Handler Threads. Because Handler threads allows message passing mechanism through loopers. with out handler threads also one can achieve with normal threads if programmer prepares its looper programmatically.
Inter thread communication : means passing some data between threads.
Every thread internally will have 2 components: Looper & Message queue.
Message Queue : is to store incoming messages
Looper : will keep checking message queue to respond to those messages.
With out Looper, it is not possible to achieve Inter thread communication.
Only Handler Threads will have loopers.
Normal Java threads will also have loopers but they will be in the passive mode. (Since looper is passive it cannot check message queue for new incoming message).
Since your looper is not active in java threads so they cannot handle inter thread communication.							
You can enable the looper by calling looper.prepare().
So, Inter thread communication is possible through only Handler Threads. Because Handler threads allows message passing mechanism through loopers.
There is one more technique to have Inter thread communication.
Share some data in some common storage, and allow both the threads to access that data by using some synchronization mechanism like wait, notify.
This is possible with normal java threads also.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between thread and handler thread, in android?
Handler thread will have looper and MessageQueue, but looper is prepared to handle incoming messages.
Description : Handler thread is extended version of thread, where its looper will be prepared to handle incoming messages from other threads (Inter thread communication). But for normal java threads, looper will be there but in passive mode, i.e not prepared for inter thread communication.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Create a thread in the activity and stop that activity, then what will happen to that thread, will it be alive or dead?
it will be alive, but its priority will be least compared to thread in a service.
Description : once a thread is created, it will run independently of who has created until the work given to that thread is finished. but in case of low memory scenarios a thread created by activity and which is running in the background will have more susceptibility of being killed by android system. More worse is android can not recreate the thread which was killed because of low memory. but if that thread was in service, then chances of getting killed by android due to low memory may be less than previous situation. even if android system kills the thread, again it will start the service when memory resources are available and service can re-initiate that killed thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between task, process, application, and thread?
process and application are same. Task may contain 1 or more applications. thread is an internal part of a process created by OS.
Description : Process - every instance of an application being executed is called as process. You execute same application two times, it will create 2 processes.
Application - is generalized term of a process. 
Task - can have one or more applications in it. 
eg: task of sending a message : we will start with message application, lets say i want to attach a photo to my message, then i will open gallery application also. In this case my task has got two applications, messaging and gallery application.
Thread - theoretically thread is a light weight process, or part of process.Practically thread is dispatch-able unit to CPU, and it is internal part of a process. With out a thread in your program it is difficult to execute your application.application. That's why by default every process will have at least one thread created by Operating system.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to avoid synchronization problems in threads?
Use synchronized block
Use Synchronized methods
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between synchronized block(statement) and synchronized methods?
syn method - all statements in this are synchronized
syn block - only this block of code is synchronized, not whole method.
syn method - if already any thread is holding lock on this function's object then other threads can't call another syn method on same object.
syn block - If a function is having 1000 lines and I access shared data
only in 5,6th line, then better to put syn block than making whole function as synchronized.
syn method - all statements in this are synchronized. if already any thread is holding lock on this function's object then other threads can't call another synchronized method on same object.
syn block - only this block of code is synchronized, not whole method. If a function is having 1000 lines and I access shared data only in 5th ,and 6th line, then better to put syn block than making whole function as synchronized.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is looper, message queue, and a Handler?
Looper - part of any Thread to loop through message queue.
Message Q - part of any thread, will store incoming messages to this thread.
Handler - communication channel between two threads.
Description :
Looper - part of any Thread to loop through message queue.This will be used to check if any incoming message has arrived to this thread. Only one looper exists for a given thread. Only for handler threads this looper will be activated, for other normal threads this will be in passive or inactive mode.
Message Q - part of any thread, will store incoming messages to this thread. For any thread only one message Q is available.
Handler - communication channel between two threads. Handler is associated with Looper. for a given looper we can n number of handlers to communicate with it from out side world.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Main thread will have a looper. True or false?
only handler threads will have loopers, but we can prepare normal threads looper also.
Description : Main Thread is a handler thread, so it will have looper enabled. Normal threads looper will be in disabled mode, where as handler threads will have their loopers enabled. but if we want we can prepare loopers for normal threads also.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When activity is moved to stopped state, then what will happen to the life cycle of a fragment which is in that activity?
fragments will be moved to onStop
Description : Since fragments are part of an Activity always, when Activity is moved to stopped state, then automatically fragments in it will be moved to stopped state.
Note: Fragments life cycle will be affected by activity's life cycle.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
The basic purpose of fragments is:
1. Fragments are designed to use the device UI space efficiently. 
When you are writing an application in android, then some people can download it into phone, some into tablets. If you see the space in tablets it will be little bigger than phones. You should be able to use that space efficiently. But you can't keep writing different applications one targeting for phone, and other targeting for tablets. In order to do it efficiently, i.e writing only application that can fit well with all screen sizes, we use fragments concept.
2. fragments are designed as a reusable UI components between more than one activity.
Once you design a fragment, you can view it as a detachable independent unit, so that you can plug it into any activity where ever there is a space. That means you can reuse the code designed for a fragment.
Fragment you can think of it like a sub activity, which sits with in an activity and which contributes its own UI to the activity screen.
Fragments are always part of an activity. With out an activity, a fragment will not exist. So your fragment life cycle will always be affected by activity life cycle.
An activity can contain more than one fragment. Similarly a fragment can be re used in multiple activities.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to find a fragment in an activity?
FragmentManager.findFragmentById(R.id.frag_id);
Description : To find if a fragment is part of an activity or not, we have to take the help of FragmentManager and use findFragmentById() function.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create different layout files portrait and landscape orientations?
Create two different xml layout files with same name, put one under res/layout-port folder and other under res/layout folder.
Android will automatically pick layout-port folder xml file for portrait mode, and other for landscape mode.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to return layout of a fragment? Which function to implement in Fragment class for it?
We have to implement onCreateView() to return the layout of fragment as part of fragments UI contribution.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Is it possible to have fragments without UI, in android?
Fragment generally will contribute its UI by using its own layout. But it might not have UI in some cases, as it is not mandatory.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If a fragment is required to display a list view in it, then there is special purpose fragment called as ListFragment to achieve it.
So use activity with ListFragment.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is a fragment in android?
Fragment is a part of an activity, which contributes its own UI to that activity. Fragment can be thought like a sub activity.
Fragments are used to efficiently use the space in wider screen devices.
An activity may contain 0 or multiple number of fragments based on the screen size. A fragment can be reused in multiple activities, so it acts like a reusable component in activities.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the difference between activity and fragment in android?
fragment is a part of an activity, which contributes its own UI to that activity. Fragment can be thought like a sub activity. Where as the complete screen with which user interacts is called as activity. An activity can contain multiple fragments.Fragments are mostly a sub part of an activity.
An activity may contain 0 or multiple number of fragments based on the screen size. A fragment can be reused in multiple activities, so it acts like a reusable component in activities.
A fragment can't exist independently. It should be always part of an activity. Where as activity can exist with out any fragment in it.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Why fragments in android? What is the use?
Fragments are used to efficiently use the space on wider screen devices.
fragments are used as a means of solving compatibility issues when targeting an android application for various screen sizes, esp for both tablets and mobiles.
Fragments can be used to reuse the same piece of UI template in multiple activities, without rewriting the entire code. These are kind of reusable components which fits into an activity.

What is empty process in android and what is its priority?
Empty process- an app which is destroyed and still in the memory.
Description : Empty process - is an application which user is frequently visiting and closing. (Which resides in memory even after killing).
To launch frequently visited app fastly, even after destroying that app, it will be still in memory so that loading time will be reduced and user feels more comfortable. That is called as empty process.
its priority is 5 (Empty_Process). this is the last and least priority of an application or a process.
When android device goes out of memory, to reclaim some memory android will start killing all the processes starting with least priority process. Empty process is the most susceptible process to be killed in case of low memory.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Can I have more than one application in a given task?
task can have n number of apps
Description : task is a collection of apps that user traverse when performing some task. 
eg: while sending message, he starts with messaging application, and may move to gallery or camera to attach some photo that message. in this scenario messaging and gallery are two different apps. but for user he is doing single task only.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Apps and process is same. Task is a collection of one or more applications. App means process, so task can contain multiple  processes.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Activities, services and other components of an applications runs in single process. there can be some situations where we can allow a component of application to run in a different process. but this is possible only if user id of those two different processes are same.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is sleep mode in android? What will happen to CPU once screen (LCD) light goes off?
Sleep mode - means CPU will be sleeping and will not accept any command except from RIL(Radio Interface Layer) and alarms. CPU will go to sleep mode with in fraction of seconds after LCD is turned off.
Description : There is small difference in power consumption when you compare a phone with laptops.
Laptops most of the times runs on direct power through charger. (Mostly we carry charge with laptop).
Mobiles mostly run on battery power. (Rarely we carry charger with us).
By keeping this in mind, android has designed in a such a way that, phone will not consume battery power if user is not interacting with the phone. This is to increase battery back up time for user.
Thats why when LCD screen power is off (that means user is not interacting with phone), with in fraction of seconds CPU will also go to a mode (sleep mode) where it does minimal work and saves battery power. When CPU is in sleep mode, it accepts commands only from RIL (radio interface layer) which is basically sms and call functions, and alarms. Other than this CPU will stop executing other applications functions.
Note : If any application wants CPU time for its emergency work when CPU is in sleep mode, then it can request CPU time by using WAKE LOCKS.
For eg : MP3 application has to keep playing songs in its service, even though user has turned off LCD screen. That means MP3 application's service has requested CPU time by using WAKE LOCKS.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How many kinds of wake locks are available, which one to use when?
PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need only CPU on
SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need CPU + Screen in dim mode
SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need CPU +  SCREEN Bright
FULL_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need all SCREEN, CPU, Keypad in bright and on.
Description : There are 4 types of wake locks available in android power manager driver:
1. PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need only CPU to be on
    eg : while traveling playing mp3 audio songs, which requires only cpu to be on.
2. SCREEN_DIM_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need CPU and Screen in dim mode
3. SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need CPU and  SCREEN in Bright mode
    eg : while traveling if we want to watch a movie in the phone, then both cpu & screen should be on. 
4. FULL_WAKE_LOCK - use it when you need all SCREEN, CPU, Keypad in bright and on.
    eg : If user is playing a game, then cpu, screen lights, and keypads lights should be on.
           Because to play a game, user might be using keyboard also to navigate or to move the elements in the game.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
while using full wake lock and user presses screen lights off (power button), then what will happen?
Screen lights & Keyboard will be off, but CPU still running.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When phone is in sleep mode, what are the two components that will keep running even though phone is in sleep mode?
RIL (Radio Interface Layer) & alarms

Every day night at 12 o clock I need to post some images to Facebook, in that case I will set repeating alarm for every day night 12 am. But to upload images I want to start service, how should I do this ?
Create a pending intent to start a service, and give it to alarm to fire at every day night 12. Also make sure to acquire full wake lock in oncreate of your service and release wake lock after uploading all images. Only for broadcast receivers tied up with alarms, will hold wake locks automatically. but if you are starting a service from alarm, them alarm manager wont hold wake lock for you. it is programmers duty to hold wake locks in service

          setContentView(label);
}
Description : First option, where static drawables are bound with process life cycle, which is pointing to label, which pointing to activity context. This is kind of dead lock situation where Android can't clean activity's resources because activity's pointer is held by label which can't be cleaned because it is pointed by process global data (static variables) drawable.

If I want to write one application for both phones and tablets, what should I use in my UI?
1. Use fragments where ever it is possible 2. Use Dps instead of pixels 3. Use xhdpi images as well.4. avoid giving margins based on pixels, rather use margins with respect to parent 5. Use SPs for font sizes. 6. Use 9 patch images always.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
I have a thousands of items in my array, and I want to display it in listview, what is the most optimized way to achieve this?
getView() function of customadapter which returns the view for each row, some times can be reused. Just check if it is not null, then re-use it.
If you are accessing data from network or SQL table, make sure you use different thread to do it, to avoid over head on Main Thread.
Use ViewHolder instead of using findViewById() to find different views while inflating the data in getView of custom adapter.
Use predefined black color background for your list view, to avoid redrawing over head on android.

Does android applications leak memory? Is there any possibility?
Java GC doesn't guarantee about memory leaks, if it finds any memory pointed by some one by mistake, then it might not clean that memory, there may be some situations where activity will be pointed by some ui controls, which will be pointed by some static variables, which leads to memory leak in android.
Java GC(Garbage Collector) doesn't guarantee about memory leaks, if it finds any memory pointed by some one, then java will assume that the memory is under use. In that case it will not clean that memory.there may be some situations where activity (this pointer) will be pointed by some UI controls, which will be pointed by some static variables, which leads to memory leak in android.
Note : Java doesn't guarantee about memory leaks. It is the programmers responsibility to use static variables and contexts properly. Else it may lead to serious memory leaks in android.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Can a static variable point to an instance variable which is pointing to an activity context?
No, it might lead to dangerous memory leaks.
Description : Having link between static variables and UI controls which points to "this" pointer (activity context), may lead to serious memory leaks. Try avoid these kind of links.

What is the life cycle of  and android application process?
(application)Process will be loaded into memory before loading first component of the application, and will be killed after destroying all components.But if user is visiting that application very frequently, then android might not kill the process at all to optimize the loading time of that application.
Description : If user is visiting an application very frequently, then its better to retain that application in the memory rather than killing it. Reason for this is, next time when user visits the same application no need to load that application into memory, as it is already in memory. So user will feel happy for showing application very quickly. This is called as empty process(application).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How serializable differ from parcel?
Parcels are used in Binders. We use parcels for only IPCs, for normal serialization we use serializables.
Description : Parcel is not a general-purpose serialization mechanism.This class is designed as a high-performance IPC transport. used heavily in IBinders. for normal serialization concepts, use Serializables. since serializables are heavy and takes time, we use Parcels for IPC in embedded devices.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Why use SQLite in android?
SQLite is a lighter version of SQL, to store data in the form of tables, targeted for embedded devices like phones and tablets.
Since embedded devices have limited CPU speed and limited memory, they can't afford heavy weight DBMS softwares like SQL and SQLServer. So embedded devices like phones and tablets opt for SQLite which is lighter version of SQL dbms, to store their data in table formats. 
SQLite is a RDBMS.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the use of SQlite open helper class in SQLite?
A helper class allows database management ,creation and version management. This is the class where we will create all the tables, and upgrade tables.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the use of onUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper?
onUpgrade is basically for handling new db changes(could be new columns addition,table addition) for any new version of your app.
Droping the table is not always necessary in onUpgrade it all depends on what your use case is. If the requirment is to not to persists the data from your older version of app then drop should help,but if its like changing schema then it should only have alter scripts.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How many ways are there to store persistent data by using an Android application?
1. Shared Preferences
2. Internal Storage
3. External Storage
4. SQLite Database
5. Storing in network servers
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Showing data base information will be better suited with table layout.  since table layout is not an adapter view, you can't use cursor adapter with it. So use table layout with cursor to show data base table information.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to detect and handle incoming calls in android application?
start listening to CALL_STATE using telephonymanager and phonestatelistener. when incoming call comes onCallStateChanged function of phonestatelistener will be called.
state CALL_STATE_RINGING will be passed to onCallStateChanged function.
If we want to handle call interruption scenarios, then get the object of TelephonyManager and start listening to CALL_STATE using PhoneStateListener class's onCallStateChanged() functionality. onCallStateChanged() function has a int state parameter which will be equal to CALL_STATE_RINGING when an incoming call arrives.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
TelephonyMnager has only 3 states, CALL_STATE_RINGING, CALL_STATE_OFFHOOK, and CALL_STATE_IDLE.

Android debugging : What is a break point and how to watch variables while debugging android program?
break point breaks the execution.  To see value either you can put cursor on it or right click on variables and add to watch
Description : Debugging : means removing the bug (issue).
There can be two types of bugs.
1. Program crash : When program crashes due to some exception, then we have to    debug the program through logcat and find the problem. These kind of    debugging will be done through logcat messages.
2. Function is not working properly : If some logic is not working properly,    then we have to analyze that function to see what logic is going wrong.    This can be done in many ways.
   a. Put toast messages in the function to see line by line analysis
   b. Put log messages by using Log.d OR other log functions, and see for
      those messages in logcat.
   c. Put break point by double clicking a particular line in eclipse.
      Break point is a point where control will stop at that line while
      executing. Once it hits that point, it will break/ halt the execution.
      There you can explore all the variable values by adding variables to
      watch windows.

What is adb? What is the command to install one application using adb command prompt?
its a client server program to communicate between development machine, and device or emulator.
Description : Android debug bridge (ADB)
  - tool used to communicate to emulator/ devices from eclipse or command prompt.
  - its a client-server program

  there are 3 components in it:
1. a client running on development machine. -> you can invoke this by issueing    adb shell command.
   (adt/ ddms also starts adb client)

3. adb-daemon that runs on emulator/ device.
   adb -> is located in  sdk/ platform-tools

   How is this connection established?
1. once you issue adb command, it starts adb client,
   then searches if server process if exists or not.
2. once server started, it will start listening --> on port 5037 --> for    commands from [adb client]
   It will start connections from client - to - adb daemons.

   how server detects adb-daemons?
   a. server will check ports 5555 -to- 5585
      if it finds any port then it will set up connection.

   Note: consoles will take up even ports, adb daemons will take up odd ports.

   eg: Emulator 1, console: 5554
       Emulator 1, adb: 5555
       Emulator 2, console: 5556
       Emulator 2, adb: 5557 ...

How to implement a snake game in android? What kind of view has to be used for this implementation?
Use Custome View and draw directly on Canvas
Description : If you want to draw some images which will not have particular x,y co-ordinates and which moves randomly in the screen, then you can't do it with android predefined views. Better directly draw on canvas by creating custom views. Once canvas is under your control, then you can move your images randomly (as snake moves randomly) on the screen.

There are 3 tween animation techniques.
1. scaling : Zooming in and Zooming out effect
2. rotating : Rotating a view clock wise or anti clock wise
3. alpha : making a view transparent or visible.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is frame animation in android?
playing frame after frame using animation-list xml property is called as frame animation.
Description : playing image frame after image frame using animation-list xml property is called as frame animation.
Note : If you play 24 frames in a second, it will become a movie.
Tween animation will be animated only by using one image frame, where as frame animation requires multiple image frames to animate. That is the main difference.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Tween animation is part of which package?
it is part of view package.
Description : tween animation is applicable to all views, so it is part of view package.

What is meta-data tag in a widget provider?
<meta-data android:name="android.appwidget.provider"
                android:resource="@xml/providerinfo"/>
it says that app widget provider info is in "providerinfo.xml" file which is in xml folder. it also says that this is not a broadcast receiver, it is a widget provider.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is action APPWIDGET_UPDATE in a widget? 
<action android:name="android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE"/>
This has to be used with widgets, if we don't use it then onUpdate function of appWidgetProvider class will not be called and widget wil not be updated.
Description : with out tag android.appwidget.action.APPWIDGET_UPDATE, android will not update the widget. Generally widgets are used as shortcuts and to display some dynamically changing content on the home screen.
If we don't use action APPWIDGET_UPDATE, then the dynamic content of widget will not get updated.
For eg : if we are using cricket score update widget on the home screen, and if we forget to give this action, then cricket widget will not update with the latest cricket score.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the tag used in manifest file to create widgets?
Receiver tag
Description : Since AppWidgetProvider is the derived class of BroadCastReceiver, so we have to use Receiver tag in manifest file.
When ever there is some content to be changed in the widget, system will broadcast that content to our widget. So widget is more of like a receiver.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What does app widget provider info xml will contain?
1. it will contain a reference to initial layout xml file. 2. it will contain what is the min width & height of the widget. 3.  it will also contain the time in milli-seconds, which tells how many seconds once widget has to be updated.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is the root tag used for app widget provider info xml file?
<appwidget-provider>
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Which of the below components will be mostly used when writing or implementing an app widget provider class?
i. RemoteViews
ii. AppWidgetManager
iii. PendingIntent
AppWidgetManager : is the class used to update the widget. 
Remoteview : is a view which can be displayed in other process. 
When we create a widget, finally we will host that widget in home scree application (not our application). Since widget view will be in different application, to update those views we have to use the concept of RemoteViews. 
Pending Intent : use it when you want to perform some intent operation at later point of time.
Since we don't know when user may click on our widget, we have to write a pending intent which will be triggered on clicking that widget to start our application activity.
Mostly when we are writing a widget, we will be using all the above components.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Widget and widget host : which of the below options are true about widgets?
The app which holds widgets of other applications is called as widget host. Contents of a widget can change dynamically. (Widget is like a dynamic shortcut).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create or implement a widget in android?
To create a widget we have to create a class that extends AppWidgetProvider. This class is inherited from BroadCastReceiver, since it has to receive the widget updates over some period of time.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is sandboxing in android?
Every application runs in a secure sandbox environment, so other processes on the system cannnot access your code or private data.
Description : Some of the core security features that help you build secure android apps include:
The Android Application Sandbox, which isolates your app data and code execution from other apps.
The application sandbox is implemented at the OS level, not by DVM.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How many levels of security available in android?
2 levels - App level, kernel level
Description : Android supports 2 levels of security for applications. one at operating system level or kernel level. other is using <permission> tags in app level.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android securities and permissions : I am downloading two applications where app1 has a service on which some permission is enforced, and app2 has an activity which will start app1's service. Now on downloading which application user will be prompted with permission dialog?

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android securities and permissions: 
For the below given problem where should I write uses-permission tag? in which application?
Problem: I am downloading two applications where app1 has a service on which some permission is enforced, and app2 has an activity which will start app1's service. Now on downloading which application user will be prompted with permission dialog?
uses-permission has to be written in app2's manifest file, after application tag.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android securities and permissions:
For the below given problem, where should I write permission tag? and how to enforce that permission on service?
Problem: I am downloading two applications where app1 has a service on which some permission is enforced, and app2 has an activity which will start app1's service. Now on downloading which application user will be prompted with permission dialog?
Permission tag has to be in app1's manifest file above application tag. and we have to enfoce this permission using android:permission attribute in <Service tag> of app 1.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Which of the below is not an attribute of permission tag?
android:id
Description : android:id will not be there for permission tag.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What are the protection levels available in android's permission tag?
normal, dangerous, signature, signatureOrsystem. These are the available protection levels available for the permission tag.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android securities and permissions : Can one application having Linux process user id 1, touch other application property or elements directly?
yes, it is possible if both applications have same user id.
Description : Generally in android one application can't touch other apps components directly due to OS level security. But if two apps are having same Linux user id, it is possible.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is Manifest file?if we have two java files A.java and B.java in your source folder which one opens first and why?
Manifest files says the capabilities of your application and number of components in your application. The manifest file presents essential information about your app to the Android system, information the system must have before it can run any of the app's code.

The activity which is having the following Intent Filter will be executed first:
<intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter>
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is Splash screen or splash activity?
Splash screen is an activity that will be shown generally as the initial screen while starting your application. This screen will be used to showcase your company's logo and other app related and company related basic information. Generally splash screen will be displayed for few seconds before going to main screen of the project.
Description : A splash screen can be designed by using some alarms or timers, so that main screen will be displayed and splash screen will be destroyed after that many seconds. Eg: Candy Crush game shows a splash screen with "King" in the starting screen before going to the actual screen. While it shows that screen it does some background work also to start next heavy activity.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Where do you write intent filters and Why?
Intent-Filters are always in AndroidManifest.xml because the Android System uses intent filters, in order to find a suitable component to handle the intent. An Intent Filter defines the intent that a component can respond to. 
We can have intentfilters in java code also in case of dynamic broadcast receivers.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to save transient states in activity life cycle? eg: If I am using some variables, which will change based on my activities life cycle, then where should I save those variables, in case of configuration changes?
Save all those variables in onSaveInstanceState().
Description : These kind of variables are called as transient state of Activity. These will not be saved by Android, it is programmers duty. So save it in onSaveInstanceState().
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Can I use onSaveInstanceState for saving all my transient states?
You should not use it for saving very large objects as it might take time to serialize and de-serialize it. so use it only for saving small transient states.
onSaveInstanceState() function has to be used for saving small objects (transient states). If we want to save large objects use onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() function.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Can I save my database updates in onSaveInstanceState() of activity life cycle ?
No, because that function might not be called all the time.
Description : We have to save all DB updates on or before onPause() function of activity life cycle. Because this is the last guaranteed function to be called on all scenarios of an activity life cycle.
Note : If you save DB in onSaveInstanceState, then that function will not be called if user presses back button on the activity.
So it will end up in loosing all the database un saved data.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If some heavy images are downloaded from internet in onCreate() of an Activity, then where to save them in case of configuration changes (rotating the phone)?
Use a static variable to point to that image, so that it will not be killed on activity death.
Use onRetainNonConfigurationInstances() function to save it.
onSaveInstanceState() function has to be used for saving small objects (transient states). If we want to save large objects use onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() function. Or else we can make that image as static, so that the image will be loaded only once.
More documentation :
onSaveInstanceState() function has to be used for saving small objects, not for heavy objects.
If you want to save heavy images on phone rotation, then use any of below techniques:
1. If you want to save large objects use onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() function.
2. Or else we can make that image as static, so that the image will be loaded only once. Meaning: On downloading an image from network, make it pointed by a static variable. If user rotates the phone, since android kills that activity and recreates it, just put a if condition check if that static variable is not null, then only download again. As you know static variables will be created only once, it will not download again.
But preferably go for 1st option.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
When starting an activity from a notification, will it start as new task or old task?
it will be started as a new task always.
Description : When we start a new activity from Notification, it is fresh starting point, so it has to be started as a new task. that's why when we are starting an activity from notification, we have to use FLAG_NEW_TASK in the intent.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What does the flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP do here in below android code?
Assume that activities in the stack are A->B->C->D. Code is currently running in activity 'D'. Now what will happen in this scenario?
Intent in = new Intent(this, B.class);
in.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP);
startActivity(in);
It will not launch one more instance of Activity 'B' on top of activity 'D'. Instead this will send a new intent to onNewIntent() function of activity 'B' and Activities C, D will be destroyed automatically.. so it will look like A->B.
Description : FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP : 
If set, and the activity being launched is already running in the current task, then instead of launching a new instance of that activity, all of the other activities on top of it will be closed and this Intent will be delivered to the (now on top) old activity as a new Intent to onNewIntent() function.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If activity is forcefully closed by Android system due to screen orientation change, then how to save UI states?
Android will save & restore UI states automatically, so programmer don't need to worry.
Description : Generally orientation changes will cause android to kill and recreate the activity. But all the UI states will be saved and restored by android automatically. But to do this programmer has to supply id for each view. Other than this programmer don't need to take any extra effort.
Note : Android will save and restore only UI states, not transient states (any variable values).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Define weigth sum and weights and where do we write them?
weight property says how much portion of remaining space has to be taken by this view.
weight sum says sum of its child view's weights.
If weight sum is not provided to the layout, then it will be automatically calculated by summing the weight of child views in that layout.
Use weight sum in the layout only if you are not going to add a new child view to your layout. It may create problem if you want to modify or add a new child view with a new weight to your existing layout. Then again you have to make sure that you modify the parent layout's weight sum as well. Else it will not work as desired.
Description : Generally we use weight property to distribute the space to the views irrespective of screen sizes. It works perfectly with all screen sizes.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In listview,content in each textview should fit perfectly in all types of mobiles?how to attain it?
Don't give hardcoded pixel or dp values to textview width. Use wrap_content for its width  and height.
if textview has a background image, make sure various density versions of same image is available in different drawable folders. Make sure it is a nine-patch image so that it stretches properly.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to stop a thread in android?
Use a volatile boolean flag, based on which return from the run() method of the Thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is a thread?Is service with Thread possible?
Thread is a dispatch able unit to the CPU.All Java programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread.
Yes Service with thread is possible. But by default service will run in main thread.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Define AsyncTask?How many methods are there and how parameters work in it?
The AsyncTask class is a way to achieve multithreading in android application, where multiple tasks can be run at a time. It synchronizes with the main thread. It also supports reporting progress of the running tasks.
There are four methods in Async Task:
1. onPreExecute()
2. doInBackground()
3. onUpdateProgress()
4. onPostExecute()
The three types of parameters in AsyncTask:
1. Params: the type of the parameters sent to the task upon execution.
2. Progress: the type of the progress units published during the background computation.
3. Result: the type of the result of the background computation.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to kill a thread?
return from run() function
Description : <threadObject>.stop() function is used to stop or kill a thread. But due to some issues with that function, stop method has been deprecated and removed. Now we can't use stop method to kill a thread. Thread will be killed automatically once we return from the run() function. In case of Handler threads it will be in dormant state unless some new message comes to its message queue.

Why android follows single threaded UI model?
Because synchronization is costly compared to single threaded model.
Description : using synchronization also it is possible to manipulate UI from other threads. But Android doesn't follow that design, because it is very costly in terms of CPU time over head if we use synchronization. So all UI updates has to go through Main Thread (or UI thread) only.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If I create a thread in my Activity and close my activity, will that thread run in the back ground or will be killed automatically on activity close? If it keeps running in the back ground, when will it be killed?
either it may run for ever if there is no condition in run() method to return, or it may be killed by android in case of low memory scenario. it is highly unpredictable how it behaves. this kind of design is wrong. if you want a thread in activity, make sure that either you kill before leaving activity, or put a condition to close it in run method, or better to start a service with thread.

Is it possible to start asynctask from background thread?
it is mandatory that one has to call asynctask only from main thread, else it may crash at run time when we try to touch UI from onPreExecute [or] onProgressUpdate [or] onPostExecute functions.
Description : it is mandatory that one has to call asynctask only from main thread, else it may crash at run time when we try to touch UI from onPreExecute [or] onProgressUpdate [or] onPostExecute functions.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what will happen if execute() function of asynctask is called more than once, for a give asynctask object?
we should not call execute() function more than once on a given asynctask object, it will throw run time exception.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
how many threads will be created with asynctask?
till donut - it is used to create single thread, from 1.6 to 2.3 - it is used to create multi threads, from 3.0 on wards - it is again used to create single thread. If you want to create multiple threads with asynctask from 3.0 on wards, instead of using execute(), use executeOnExecutor(Executor e, variable). They have reverted back the basic functionality if asynctask.execute() to behave as a single threaded, because multi threded programming will lead to lot of complications in terms of synchronization.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
How to create a service with single thread? should I use IntentService or AsyncTask?
Use IntentService, if you don't want to interact with UI.
Use AsyncTask if you want to interact with UI.
It actually depends on the requirement. Use IntentService, if you don't want to interact with UI. Use AsyncTask if you want to interact with UI from background thread. It doesn't mean that you can't touch UI from IntentService, but you have to either use post() or runOnUiThread() or Handler concepts, which are little bit complicated to understand for novice android developers who are not well versed with threads.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In which thread asynctask functions will execute?
onPreExecute, onProgressUpdate, onPostExecute - runs in Main thread, doInBackGround - runs in background Thread.

What are the mandatory functions we have to implement while writing a custom adapter by extending BaseAdapter class?
getView, getItem, getItemId, and getCount are the mandatory functions that have to be implemented in Custom Adapter.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is base adapter?what are the functions available in it?
Base Adapter is a common base class for any adapter that can be used in both ListView and Spinner. Base adapter is an abstract class which implements both ListAdapter and SpinnerAdapter interfaces.
While creating custom adapters, mostly programmers will extend this class.
Functions available in Base Adapter:
1. getCount()
2. getItem()
3. getList()
4. getView()

How to generate alternate colours for child views in list view?
Take two layout xml files with a view. First xml file will contain a view with red color, and second xml file will contain a view with gree color. In custom adapter of the listview, go to getView() method and check the current position, if it is divisible by 2 apply first xml else apply second xml.
take one xml file with a view. Go to custom adapter of the listview and go to getView() method. In that method check the current position, if it is divisible by 2 set one background color for the view else set a different background color for the same view.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In custom adapter what is converView parameter in getView() function?

public View getView(int position, 
                    View convertView, ViewGroup parent)
{
 ....
}
it will be not null if android is returning previous view which was created and went out of scope, for reuse.
Description : getView function has to create view for each row for adapterview and return it. But at a given point of time only few rows or elements of an adapterview will be visible to user. So it is unnecessary to create all the views if it is not visible to user. Rather we can reuse the old views which went out of scope. In order to reuse the previously created rows/ view which are currently not visible to user, they will be passed as second parameter to this function to reuse those views.
Programmer can check if(convertView != null) , then he or she can reuse that view.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In custom adapter getView function, while inflating a view what will happen if we pass true as last parameter to inflate function?
Note: below function is a customAdapters function.

public View getView(int position, 
                        View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
RelativeLayout rl = (RelativeLayout getLayoutInflater()
                        inflate(R.layout.row, parent, false);
}
It will inflate the view two times in the parent adapter view.
Description : Don't pass true, other wise same view will be inflated to list view or destination two times.
Just pass false.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Android listview with custom row with a radio button, focus problem:
If row.xml is having a radio button, and a text view, then will onItemClickListener work for this adapter view (assume listview) on which we are setting this custom adapter?
Note: below function is a customAdapters function.

public View getView(int position, 
                        View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

RelativeLayout rl = (RelativeLayout) getLayoutInflater().
                        inflate(R.layout.row, parent, false);
....

}
It will not call onItemClickListener if there are any focus able items like radio button available in each row. to solve this make onFocusable="false" in the xml file of Row.

What is 9 patch tool in android?
i. we can set scaling factor on x, y directions of our image using this tool. This is to make sure that image will be stretched & compressed properly based on screen sizes.
ii. we can set padding factor on x, y directions of our image using this tool. This is to make sure that content of that image will be aligned properly.
Generally when we use some images in our projects as background for some views, and that application is downloaded into various devices with different screen sizes, then based on the screen sizes that image will stretch and adjust it self to the scree sizes.
But the problem is, when the image gets stretched to fit the screen size, some times the resolution of the image gets damaged and will not look good in bigger screen devices.
To avoid this problem, we use 9 patch tool.
Using 9 patch tool, we can set scaling factor on x, y directions of our image using this tool. This is to make sure that image will be re sized properly based on screen sizes. And we can also set padding factor on x, y directions of our image using this tool. padding factor is to make sure that content of that image will be aligned properly in the image.

What is the difference between parcelable and serializable?
Parcels are light weight serializables. It is preferred to use parcels for marshaling objects into byte streams.
Description : These concepts are related to Inter Process Communication (IPC).
When sending data between two applications, we have to make sure that both applications should understand the format of the data that is being sent.
Especially when you are sending non primitive data type values like classes and objects between two applications, We have to convert them into Operating System understandable format. O.S understands only primitive types (ints, chars etc). The reason for conversion is we have to O.S communication channel to transmit the data.
This process of converting Non primitive types to primitives and sending across to other application over some communication channel is called as Serialization. The reverse process is called as De Serialization.
In Java, IPC depends heavily on Serializables for serialization. But serialization is designed by keep desktop applications in mind. When you are doing IPC in mobile applications we have to make sure that the process of IPC is not too heavy. 
In simple terms serialization is a heavy concept for IPC.
So in place of Serialization Android opted for Binders for achieving light weight Inter process communication. Binders internally depends heavily on parcels, to do the IPC.
Parcels are light weight serializables. It is preferred to use parcels for marshaling objects into byte streams.
Note: Binder IPC heavily depends on Shared memory concept to make sure that there is not much data duplication while sharing between applications.

How to make an android application compatible with phone and tablet? What components should be used when writing an application targeting for both mobile phones and tablets?
i. Activity
ii. Fragment
iii. 9 patch tool
iv.  for layouts don't use absolute layout. preferred to use Relative layout. Also while mentioning width/ height/ or margins don't mention in hard coded dp's or pixels, mention with respect to its parent.
Compatibility : Is to create an application targeting for both mobiles and tablets efficiently (keeping space and size in mind).
For that we have to use 
1.Activities
2. Fragments.  (To use space efficiently in tablets)
3. Since device screen sizes may vary, we have to make sure that our images used in that application should re-sized properly for all screen sizes. This can be achieved using draw9patch tool. (9 patch images)
4. We have to minimize the usage of absolute layouts and hard coded pixels in the xml layout files. Because if we use absolute pixels then it won't look proper when screen sizes changes. We should always mention the pixels in terms of screen width and height in which our application is downloaded. This can be done by using dp (density independent pixels).
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Which of the below options are used to solve compatibility issues when using an Android app with both tablets and phones.
Fragments
9 patch tool
avoiding using hard coded size for margins, heights, and widths.
Compatibility issues generally arise when our application is downloaded into devices with different screen sizes and screen resolutions. So first basic problem may come in case of tablets as activity don't use space efficient, so we have to sue fragments also. second problem may come in image scaling and re-sizing, so we have to use 9patch tool. third problem may come if we use hard coded or absolute pixels in xml layout files, so avoid it.

How to avoid memory leaks in android,in case if it occurs because of a link between static variable & and a UI control which is using this pointer.
i. Use getApplicationContext() while creating that UI control.
ii. Use view.getBackGround().setCallBack(null), to remove a connection between static variable and the UI control.
Either use getApplicationContext() while creating UI control. Or break the link between static variable and the UI control.
Below is one example program, on memory leak and how to resolve it.
public class MemoryleakActivity extends Activity {
    /** Called when the activity is first created. */
    private static Drawable sBackground;

If you have multiple Broadcast receivers how do you identify for which application is it coming?
Question is not so clear. But if the question is how does Android sends broadcasted message to different application, then it is based on the action, data, and category present in the intent.
Android will perform action test, data & type test, and category test. If all the test are passing with any of the intent filters of receivers, then those receivers will be triggered.
If multiple receivers intent-filters are matching with the intent then all the receivers will be triggered. But there is no specific order if priority is not set in the intent filter.

Do you require any key for development?
If you are planning to release any application into the market, then it is mandatory to sign your application with private key.
But at the initial stages, you can use debug key which is located in c:\users\<username>\.android folder.
But remember you can't release an application which is signed with your debug key. You have to sign with a private key obtained with keytool
command. keytool is a .bat file available in java\jdk\bin folder. 
You can use keytool to create your own private key with password. 
Note: Important to remember that don't ever forget your key and password, else it would become impossible to upgrade your application.
To upgrade your application you have to sign with same application.

Difference between Set and Array List? (java)
set interface: 1. Sets can't contain duplicate values (just like a mathematical set), 
                         2. Sets inherits collection and adds method to avoid duplications

There are 3 Set implementations:

1. hashset
   - uses hash table/ hashmap internally to store values, 
   - it is very fast compared to other two set implementations, 
   - it will not have any order while reading, 
   - it will not contain any duplicate elements, 
   - it is not synchronized by default
   - will not guarantee any order over time
   - iteration order/ reading order is not predictable.
     the order in which u entered may differ while reading.

2. treeset
   - internally uses red-black tree to store the values, 
   - it will maintain ascending order
   - it is slowest of all other 2 set implementations.
   - rest of the properties remain same

3. linkedhash set
   - internally uses hash table with linked list to store values.
   - same as hashset but order in which user entered will be persisted.
   - it is neither fast nor slow comparatively.
   - rest of the properties remain same.


list
----
 - it is ordered (maintains the insertion order) & may contain duplicate values
 - inherits from collection, and add functions for indexof, search functionalities.

List implementations
1. arraylist  (better performance) - same as vector .. 
2. linked list (better performace in some circumstances)

What is an Interface? Explain with realtime use case? (java)
Interface: as name suggests, it is an interface between your class and out side world.
                  interfaces can contain only constants, method declarations, and nested types. It can't contain method definitions.
                  Just like an abstract class, you can't create object for an interface.
                  You can imagine interface just like a header file in c program. It tells what all the functionalities supported by your interface.
                   
Use cases of Interfaces:

1. It can be used as APIs for third party libraries or server side libraries when using with client application. This is the main use case.
    Eg: If you are selling some libraries to some clients, then you will not expose the code. Rather you give in terms of .lib format.
          But since lib is unreadable format, you have to create an interface file telling what all the functions available in that library.
    Eg: Similarly if you want to access some server side functionalities in your client application, then also we use interfaces with some libraries.

2. You can use interfaces to implement multiple inheritance.

What are the methods in Async Task?
Async Task: is a way to achieve multi threading in android. It has some advantages over normal java threads.
                       1. You don't need to use any Thread keyword, every thing will be taken care by AsyncTask class internally. 
                            It creates threads internally.
                        2. Since android follows single threaded UI model, where other threads can't touch UI components directly.
                             But from async task you can directly touch UI components from all the functions except from doInBackGround().

AsyncTask class will have 4 functions.
a. onPreExecute() - this is the first function to be called before calling doInBackGround(). This runs in UI thread. You can touch ui from this.
b. doInBackGround() - this runs in background thread created by AsyncTask class. Don't touch ui from this method.
                                         Write background heavy logic in this function, as it runs in background thread.
c. onProgressUpdate() - this function is used to update UI while performing background functionality. to execute this call publishProgress()
                                             this also runs in UI thread.
d. onPostExecute() - once doInBackGround() is finished this function will be called. If you want to update any UI after doInBackGround() use this                                 
                                     function. This also runs in main ui thread.

Async task use case: If you want to upload some images to facebook server and want to update UI (progress bar) while uploading images using progress bar, then you can use AsyncTask.

What is a Handler & what is the function of the Handler in Android?
Handler : is used to communicate between two threads.

Use of Handler: If you want to send or pass some message from one thread to other thread, then we can use Handlers.
                             1. A thread can have n number of handlers allowing other threads to communicate with it.
                             2. If we have Thread-A and Thread-B, and if Thread-B wants to send a message to Thread-A, then We have to create a handler
                                  for Thread-A and send message to that handler. Via handler Thread-B can send messages to Thread-A.

Anchor view tells about the relative position of view with respect to a given anchor view.
For eg: android:layout_above property will make sure that the current view's base line will be above the anchor view id given in this property.

More about anchor:
----------------------------
android:layout_above		Positions the bottom edge of this view above the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignBaseline		Positions the baseline of this view on the baseline of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignBottom		Makes the bottom edge of this view match the bottom edge of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignEnd		Makes the end edge of this view match the end edge of the given anchor view ID. 
android:layout_alignLeft		Makes the left edge of this view match the left edge of the given anchor view ID.

How to pass the objects to all activities?
If you want to pass objects between activities, there are multiple options for this.
1. You can implement Serializable for that class, and then pass serializable object in putExtra of intent.
2. Since serializables are heavy compared to parcels, second and better option can be passing parcels in extras.

1st way:
-----------
class ABC implements Serializable{
 ....
}

ABC a = new ABC();
Intent in = new Intent();
in.putExtra("class",a); //this should take serializable objects

2nd way:
------------
Though parcels are fast compared to serializables, but building a parcel is very tough and complicated.
It may affect the readability of the program. Parcels are heavily used only in IPCs (Inter Process Communications) and Binder Services by android
Otherwise to make it simple for reading, better to go with serializables.

If an activity is in foreground what all the lifecycle methods to be called?
If an activity is in foreground, then android will call onCreate(), onStart(), and onResume() sequentially before making it as foreground.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In life cycle in general it will be on Pause() ->on Stop but tell me example for on Pause()->on Resume()
eg 1. When your activity is in foreground or running state, turn off the LCD (will call onPause on your activity), and again turn on LCD (will call onResume)
eg 2. When your activity is in foreground or running state, display an activity in theme dialog  (will call onPause of your old activity), once dialog themed activity gets destroyed android will call onResume of your old activity.
eg 3. When your activity is in foreground or running state, display an activity which is transparent (will call onPause of your old activity), once transparent activity gets destroyed android will call onResume of your old activity.

Have u worked on AIDL?
 Only if one is working on binder services, then only there is a fair chance of working on AIDL. IPC (Inter Process Communication) in android happens through kernel level Binder driver.
    AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) is a mechanism which internally uses Binders to access or to bind services of other applications.
    Binder is an efficient way to do IPC when compared to serialization, thats why AIDL adopts Binder.

    When a client application binds a remote service (which is in other application), that service will return an object using which client can call remote methods.
    Since both client and service are in different applications, client would not know the type of object which is going to be returned. This is where AIDL
    will be useful. 

    Steps to implement AIDL in service side (server side):
    1. create aidl file, which contains function declarations which you want to expose to the client.
    2. implement interface stub method in your service file.
    3. create an object for stub and return it as binder object to client

    steps to implement AIDL in client side:
    1. implement ServiceConnection object, and get the binder object in 
    onServiceConnected() method, using aidl file interface name which was exposed by service. 
    2. Start calling remote methods by using that object.

There are very negligible number of devices who runs version 1 of android. It is almost deprecated completely. Setting min sdk is to make sure that an application is reaching wide range of users. As of today it will be sufficient to reach major number of users if we set min sdk version as 2.2.

What are the basic uses of manifest file?
Every application will contain one manifest file which contains important information about the application which system must know before it can run the application.  1. It contains package name of your application. 2. it contains various components used in the application like how many activities, services, receivers and content providers available in your application. 3. It contains all permissions required to run the application properly. 4. It contains minimum level of api required to run this application. 5. It lists all the libraries required to run the application. etc.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is the use of registering broadcast receiver in manifest file?
Registering a receiver in manifest file makes sure that our receiver will be triggered even if our application is not running currently. For example when a new incoming SMS comes it should be handled by Messaging application even if it is not running currently. In this case programmer has to register the receiver in messaging application's manifest file to respond to incoming sms.

Commands to write or create .apk file?
	1. use javac to compile your java files
    2. use dx tool to convert all .class files to single dex file
    3. use aapt tool or apkbuilder tool to generate .apk file, which contains    manifest, .dex, and res.
       .apk is equivalent to .jar in java. 
       aapt tool and dx tools are in android-sdk/platform-tools.
    4. sign the apk file by using jarsigner tool of jdk/bin
    5. zipalign your signed apk by using zipalign tool of android-sdk/tools

Can we create all ui coding  in activity without using xml?
	Ui can be completely created through programming. But that is not recommended. There should be clear separation between design and the logic. That is the reason why android has given res folder to create all the designs like layouts, menus, icons, and styles. If project demands some dynamic changes to the UI, which can't be done in the xml files, then programmer can use any View or ViewGroup classes to design the UI through programming.

    lLayout = new LinearLayout(this);
            lLayout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.VERTICAL);
    LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
    LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT));
            tView = new TextView(this);
            tView.setText("Hello, This is a view created programmatically!");
            tView.setLayoutParams(new LayoutParams(
    LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
    LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT));
            lLayout.addView(tView);
            setContentView(lLayout);

When I run any application where fragments are there which method will be called first?
Just like Activities has life cycle methods, similarly fragments also have their life cycle methods. When we load a fragment first method to be called is onAttach(), followed by onCreate(), which is followed by onCreateView(). Generally programmers will not implement onAttach() method. onCreate() is where we will initialize all the variables which are used in the fragment. onCreateView() is where we will inflate or load the xml file of our fragment and return it to the parent (activity).

Asked about memory leakage?How to handle it
To fix memory leaks, first we should know if our application is leaking any memory. For that use Logcat and check for GC messages and observe if free memory is going down. To understand this you can rotate your phone for couple of times and observe gc messages in logcat if free memory is going down. If you see that free memory is going down, that is an indication of memory leak. To fix memory leaks you can use MAT(memory analyzer tool) of eclipse. Before doing that you should create a hprof file which contains the memory status of your application. Open up hprof file in the memory analyzer tool to check for dominator tree and find out what is causing for your memory leak. Note: 70-80% of the memory will leaked by bitmap images, so be careful while using them, and try to avoid un necessery static pointers to them to avoid memory leaks.

What is an Interface and What is an Abstract class? (java)
Abstract class: is an incomplete class. This is a kind of a house under construction which is not yet completed.
                            Since abstract classes are incomplete, you can't create any object for that class. It doesn't make any sense to create object.
                            But any one can inherit abstract classes to give extra definition for that class to make it more concrete.
                            Abstract class can contain 0 or more number of abstract methods. If it is having at least one abstract method, then 
                            we have to make that class as abstract class.
                             A class will become abstract class, if we know only partial implementation of that class.
                             Abstract class can contain method definitions.

Interface: as name suggests, it is an interface between your class and out side world.
                  interfaces can contain only constants, method declarations, and nested types. It can't contain method definitions.
                  Just like an abstract class, you can't create object for an interface.
                  You can imagine interface just like a header file in c program. It tells what all the functionalities supported by your interface.

Explain about Async Task with one use case
Async Task: is a way to achieve multi threading in android. It has some advantages over normal java threads.
                       1. You don't need to use any Thread keyword, every thing will be taken care by AsyncTask class internally. 
                            It creates threads internally.
                        2. Since android follows single threaded UI model, where other threads can't touch UI components directly.
                             But from async task you can directly touch UI components from all the functions except from doInBackGround().

AsyncTask class will have 4 functions.
a. onPreExecute() - this is the first function to be called before calling doInBackGround(). This runs in UI thread. You can touch ui from this.
b. doInBackGround() - this runs in background thread created by AsyncTask class. Don't touch ui from this method.
                                         Write background heavy logic in this function, as it runs in background thread.
c. onProgressUpdate() - this function is used to update UI while performing background functionality. to execute this call publishProgress()
                                             this also runs in UI thread.
d. onPostExecute() - once doInBackGround() is finished this function will be called. If you want to update any UI after doInBackGround() use this                                 
                                     function. This also runs in main ui thread.

Async task use case: If you want to upload some images to facebook server and want to update UI (progress bar) while uploading images using progress bar, then you can use AsyncTask.

What is Mutable and Imutable explain with examples? (java)
There are many concepts related to mutability and immutability.

General meaning:
Mutable : means changeable;   Immutable : means unchangeable.

Some of the Immutable concepts:
----------------------------------------------
Immutable classes : are also known as final classes. A class which you can't inherit (can't change the definition by extending it) is called as 
immutable class. In some languages it is also called as shield classes. Eg: String class in java is immutable class, you can't inherit it.
use case: If you don't want any one to inherit your class and change the basic functionality of your class, then make it as immutable class.
This can be achieved by making your class as final class by using "final" keyword before your class. 

Immutable variables (also know as final variables): also known as constants
Any variable that is declared as final, you can't modify its value. 
eg: public static final double pi = 3.14; // we know that pi value will always remain same 3.14, no body can change its value. So we are declaring it as final , ie constant. So that no one can change its value.

Immutable methods (final methods): says, no body can modify or change my functionality.
Inherited classes (derived classes) can't override immutable methods. 
use case: Framework generally gives lot of basic functionality where derived classes can't change. such kind of methods are made as final methods by using "final" keyword before that method name.

Immutable objects: (Note: don't misunderstand this with immutable variables)
an object for which we can't change the states(data) of it once it is set. If we can achieve this , then that object is called as immutable object.
For eg: String str = "hello"; 
In the above example hello is immutable, no body can change it. If you try to change it it will create a new string object.
String objects are examples of immutable objects.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Can class be immutable? (java)
Yes, a class can be immutable. You can make a class as final to make it immutable

Immutable classes : are also known as final classes. A class which you can't inherit (can't change the definition by extending it) is called as 
immutable class. In some languages it is also called as shield classes. Eg: String class in java is immutable class, you can't inherit it.
use case: If you don't want any one to inherit your class and change the basic functionality of your class, then make it as immutable class.
This can be achieved by making your class as final class by using "final" keyword before your class. 
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Difference between Final ,Finally and Finalize (java)
final - means immutable. eg: final classes, final methods, final variables.
           once you say final, it is the final definition of that component, no one can change it.

finally - is used with try-catch block to make sure that you are cleaning all the system resources properly when an exception occurs.
             what ever the code you write, will be executed with out fail once try block exits.

finalize - is the method that will be executed(called) before that object is being garbage collected.
                Garbage collector will make sure that it will finalize() method of an object, before it cleans that object.
                Garbage collector will clean only java resources and java memory. In your program if you are using any non java resources like files,  
                sockets, graphic contexts, or allocating memory using a c program then garbage collector will not clean all those resources.
                It is the responsibility of the programmer to clean them properly, For that we use finalize method.
                Note: Don't depend too much on finalize() method to clean non java resources.

What is thread? Why we use Thread? (java)
Thread: is independent dispatch-able unit to cpu. each thread can execute an independent module in parallel with CPU.
               Thread is also known as light weight process. Each process can contain multiple threads.
               Threads will share the resources of its process.

Why to use a thread: Generally your CPU might have the capability of running multiple tasks at a time by using its threads.
                                      But programmer has to support this by creating multiple threads for his program where ever it is possible.
                                      If your program is having two modules, and there is no dependency between those two modules, then
                                      your program can run faster if you run both the modules at a time (in parallel). This can be done only
                                      if you are running those two modules in two different threads.

What are the layouts in Android?
Layouts are viewgroups, which can contain child views in it.
There are 4 basic layouts in android.

1. linear layout: displays child views in linear fashion (either horizontally or vertically).
2. frame layout: displays child views in stack architecture (one on top of each other). It is also used as place holder for the elements.
3. relative layout: displays child views in relative position to other child views. This is heavily used layout in android.
4. absolute layout: displays child views with absolute position. This is deprecated because of its absolute positioning.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is a Broadcast Receiver?
Broadcast Receiver: is the component of android which gets triggered when ever android systems sends a broadcast announcement.
                                      Generally, when ever an important event happens in the phone (like battery low), android system will send a broad
                                      cast message to all the applications. Who ever is interested to catch that message can use Broadcast Receiver to
                                      handle that message.

Note: Broadcast receiver has a time limitation of 10 seconds. What ever you want to do in a receiver, you have to finish it off in 10 seconds.
           Else android may force close your receiver.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What is an Intent?
Intent: is a message passing mechanism between 2 components of android.
There are 2 use cases of intents.

1. You can start other component using intent, except content provider.
    eg: you can start one activity from other activity by using intent. 
           You can also start a service from an activity.

2. You can use intent to pass some data from one component to other component.
    Eg: you can pass username and password from login screen to home screen of your application.

There are two types of intents are there in android. a. Explicit intent b. Implicit intent.

How do you know whether GPS is on or Off in your moble?
//declare location manager
LocationManager lm;
//define location listner
private LocationListener ll = new LocationListener() {
	@Override
	public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) {
		//called when user enables gps or wifi in the phone
	}
	@Override
	public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) {
		// called when user disables gps or wifi in the phone	
	}
};

//create location manager object
lm = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
//request for location updates
lm.requestLocationUpdates(
			LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 
			0, 0, ll);
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If GPS is not on is there any other way to find the location?
If GPS is not available, then you can use NETWORK_PROVIDER which uses wi-fi signals or cell tower information to find out your mobile location.

How do we solve Resolution Problem
There are many solutions for this resolution problem:

1. Always use dps, don't use pixels
2. Use nine patch (.9.png) images in places of normal images. Normal png images won't stretch properly.
3. Use relative layouts where ever it is possible.
4. Don't give hard coded width and height, always mention height and width relative to parent view or layout.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
why to extend application class, how to access common variables in all activities? What is the use of Application class?
	There are two contexts in Android.
    1. Activity level context
    2. Application level context

    Application level context will be created while creating your application. There will be only one application context shared for all the components of your application.
    So if you want to share some temporary variables with all the components of your application, then create your own class which extends Application class. Use setters and getters to share some variables in that class.

    Note: Make sure that you give android:name as your class which extended Application class,in the <application .. >tab of manifest file.

    The other uses of Application class is, if you want to do some task before loading your first activity, then write it in Application class's onCreate() method. Application class also has some useful methods which will get triggered in case of low memory, which you can use to check if your app is running on low memory to alert user.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is viewholder?
	ViewHolder is a technique used in Adapter's getView() method,
    to reduce the no of findViewById() calls.
    Adapters are intelligent enough to reuse the old views while user scrolls throught the adapter view elements. Programmer should check if convertView is not null, then reuse it rather than creating a new view for that row.
    Apart from this we can optimize it more by reducing number of findViewById() calls by moving all those into ViewHolder class.
    Programmer can also move some reusable components like arrays or database query results also into ViewHolder to avoid unncessery function calls.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
what is beanclass?
	A bean class is a plain old java class, which has
    1. no argument constructor
    2. all its fields as private with setters and getters
    3. and implements Serializable.

    Basically bean class can be used as an object which itself can hold other states and objects.
    It implements serializable enabling the programmer to transfer it out of java memory, like into some streams, or hard disk, or database, or to some network. It enable java programmer to not loose an objects state while transferring into streams.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
If I close the application, will it destroy all the static variables?
	Don't rely on static variables, because static variables may not be cleand properly on the application exit. 
    Static variables will be created when the class containing them is loaded first or used first. They will be destroyed once JVM unloads that class from the memory.
    But Android has a concept of empty process, which says your app may not be removed from the memory if it is frequently used by user, in which case your static variables will not be cleard of completely.
    Better to rely on Application class which will be created properly on application startup time and will be cleard of once user exits app. This is the best way to share some temporary variables between the components.

    Note: Static variables are considered as anti-design of android apps from ages.

    Still if you want to rely on static variables due to some reasons, then try to understand what is the scope of that variable and try to initialize some null values to it on shutting down the last component which is accessing that variable. But again it is a complicated logic.

How do you join 2 Notifications?
//Below are the steps to create notifications.
//create variables
NotificationManager nm;
Notification n;
//initialize all the variables.
//step1: create notification manager object
nm = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(
			Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
//step2: prepare the ticker text and ticker icon
n = new Notification(R.drawable.ic_launcher, 
			"Urgent Msg", System.currentTimeMillis());
//step3: create intent to start activity
Intent in = new Intent(getApplicationContext(),
					MyNotifcationActivity.class);
//spte4: prepare the pending intent for above intent
PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getActivity(
				getApplicationContext(), 
				0, 
				in, 
				0);
//step5: set the latest event information & pass the pi
n.setLatestEventInfo(getApplicationContext(), 
			"Urgent Message", 
			"Please click here to read the 	message",
			pi);
			
n.flags = n.flags | Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;
//step6: use notification mgr to notify or to push
nm.notify(1, n); //1 is the id of this notification.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Now if you want to merge two notifications, when you are notifying
       next time, use same id of previous notification. "1"

How do you register a Fragment?
To register a fragment with an xml file, go to xml file and use <fragment> tag with name as the complete package qualifier name of your fragment class. For eg:

<fragment android:id="@+id/myfrag"
	    android:name="com.skillgun.fragments.MyFrag"
	    android:layout_width="0dp"
	    android:layout_height="match_parent"
	    android:layout_weight="2"/>

Once you load this xml file using your activity, automatically Android will load an instance of your Fragment class (i.e object of MyFrag class)
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
In Manifest file what is config.uses and config.orientation/config.keyboard
Generally when ever there is a configuration change in the phone, like screen orientation changes [or] soft keyboard availability [or] language changes, in these scenarios android will automatically kill and restart your activity to take the new resources effective. 

But you have the choice of requesting android to not restart your activity, and you can handle configuration changes on your own.
This can be done by using android:configChanges property in your activity tag, of your manifest.xml file.

<activity android:name=".MyActivity"
          android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden"
          android:label="@string/app_name">

The above activity tag says to android that, don't kill and restart my activity in case of screen orientation or keyboard availability.
Instead android will call  onConfigurationChanged() of your activity.

<uses-configuration> tag indicates what all hardware and software features are required for your application.

In HTTP request what header will do?
HTTP Request header can have various things based on your requirement.

3. you can also set "accept-charset" for the header.

What is URI?
URI : Uniform Resource Indicator. Used to access or send data in Android.

Just like how we access the data stored in the web servers by using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), Similarly we send or receive data in Android by using URI's

Some of the examples for URI's:
for telephone numbers we use "tel:<number>"
for content stored in databases we use "content:// ...."
for emails we use "email: <email>"

This is similar to how we access gmail by using "http://gmail.com"

How do you load fragment into Activity?
1.Create a layout for your fragment
2.Implement a fragment by defining a class for your fragment code, by extending Fragment class.
3.Return your fragment layout from your fragment's life cycle funciton onCreateView()
4.Define an xml file for your activity, which has <fragment> tag, which will contain your fragment class

Now run your program, once android sees <fragment> tag in your activity's layout file, it will go and create object for your fragment and loads it into 
your activity.

What is Handler.message and Handler.post?
These are the mechanisms to do inter thread communication.
For example we have thread-1 and thread-2, now thread-2 want to communicate with thread-1.
For this we have to create a handler for thread-1 using its looper. 
Once we create handler for thread-1, thread-2 can use that handler to send messages to thread-1.
Handler.Message is the class which we use to create messages to send to other threads.
Handler.post() is the method, which we use to post a Runnable Interface object to a thread's handler.
You can use Handler.sendMessage() to send a simple messages created by Handler.Message class.


Example of sending message to other threads:
// First create a handler implementation
class MyHandler extends Handler{
		public MyHandler(Looper l){
			super(l);
		}
		@Override
		public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), 
					"thread created", 
					0).show();
			super.handleMessage(msg);
		}
	}

// create object for your handler , pass other thread's looper.
MyHandler mh = new MyHandler(getMainLooper());
// create a message
Message m = new Message();
				m.arg1 = 1;
// pass that message to handler (mh) , which is connected to other thread.
mh.sendMessage(m);
